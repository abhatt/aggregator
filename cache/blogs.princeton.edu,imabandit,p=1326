<li>The main culprit is definitely the COLT 2018 chairing. This year we received a surprise 50% increase in number of submissions. This is great news for the community, and it led to <a class="liinternal" href="https://easychair.org/smart-program/COLT2018/">a truly fantastic program</a>. We are looking forward to see many of you in Stockholm! Note that the early registration deadline is tomorrow (May 30th).</li>
<li><a class="liinternal" href="https://www.ems-ph.org/journals/show_issue.php?issn=2520-2316&amp;vol=1&amp;iss=1">The first volume</a> of our new Mathematical Statistics and Learning journal just got published. If you care about being evaluated by top experts, and/or get the visibility of being in a highly selective mathematical journal, you should consider submitting your highest quality work there!</li>
<li>The first set of video lectures on <a class="liinternal" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SebastienBubeck">the youtube channel</a> is now complete. I realize that the quality is not perfect and that it is hard to read the blackboard. I will try to improve this for the future videos (which should be posted some time during the summer).</li>
<li>Finally I am quite excited to have <a class="liinternal" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10204">a first preprint</a> (joint work with <a class="liexternal" href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~ecprice/">Eric Price</a> and <a class="liinternal" href="https://www.ilyaraz.org/">Ilya Razenshteyn</a>) at least loosely related to <a class="liinternal" href="https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/2015/03/20/deep-stuff-about-deep-learning/">deep learning</a>. It is titled “Adversarial examples from computational constraints”, which sums up the paper pretty well. In a nutshell, we prove that avoiding adversarial examples is computationally hard, even in situations where there exists a very robust classifier. We are looking forward to get the deep learning community’s feedback on this work!</li>
