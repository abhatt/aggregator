Sadly, for example, I missed Crypto last year for the first time since 1999.</p>
<p>I’m not teaching this semester, so perhaps things will change a bit. This week I am attending (part of) the third &lt;a href=”<a href="http://realworldcrypto.wordpress.com/”&gt;Real-World" rel="nofollow">http://realworldcrypto.wordpress.com/”&gt;Real-World</a> Cryptography workshop&lt;/a&gt;. The workshop seems to have become a big success, with over 400 registrants last I heard — that is, roughly the same number of attendees as (or even slightly more than) Crypto or Eurocrypt. What explains its popularity? There are a couple of obvious possibilities, including the location (last year at Stanford, this year in NYC)</p>
<p> and the free registration. Somehow the workshop has generated lots of “buzz”; the fact that it is <em>not</em> an academic workshop probably helps attract a lot of people outside academia, or in areas related to (but not directly in) cryptography.</p>
<p>I’m here only through today, and I’ll try live-blogging the talks (at least until my battery runs out!)</p></div></content><updated planet:format="January 14, 2014 03:35 PM">2014-01-14T15:35:58Z</updated><published planet:format="January 14, 2014 03:35 PM">2014-01-14T15:35:58Z</published><category term="Crypto"/><category term="Random"/><category term="Security"/><author><name>jonkatz</name></author><source><id>https://jonkatz.wordpress.com</id><logo>https://s0.wp.com/i/buttonw-com.png</logo><link href="https://jonkatz.wordpress.com/category/tcs/feed/" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="https://jonkatz.wordpress.com" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="https://jonkatz.wordpress.com/osd.xml" rel="search" type="application/opensearchdescription+xml"/><link href="https://jonkatz.wordpress.com/?pushpress=hub" rel="hub" type="text/html"/><subtitle>Random thoughts about random things...by Jonathan Katz</subtitle><title>TCS – Random bits</title><updated planet:format="December 17, 2018 05:29 AM">2018-12-17T05:29:28Z</updated><planet:module>toc</planet:module><planet:format>atom10</planet:format><planet:http_etag>W/&quot;f68702a61d1c1378b1780332cf6a55a8&quot;</planet:http_etag><planet:http_last_modified>Mon, 17 Dec 2018 05:29:27 GMT</planet:http_last_modified><planet:bozo>false</planet:bozo><planet:items_per_page>40</planet:items_per_page><planet:css-id>jonathan-katz</planet:css-id><planet:face>katz.png</planet:face><planet:name>Jonathan Katz</planet:name><planet:http_location>https://jonkatz.wordpress.com/category/tcs/feed/</planet:http_location><planet:http_status>301</planet:http_status></source></entry>
