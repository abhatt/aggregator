<p>You!</p>
<p>We already have some fantastic speakers confirmed (schedule and workshop website coming soon), including an opening overview talk by <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/costis/">Costis Daskalakis</a>, who recently received the <a href="https://theorydish.blog/2018/08/07/nevalinna-prize-congratulations-costis/">Nevalinna Prize</a> (in part) for his work on total search problems.<br/>
By the way, if you have something interesting to tell the community about total search problems, and we haven’t contacted you yet about giving a talk, please let us know. We can probably still accommodate you in the schedule, even if you don’t have a Nevalinna Prize.</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing y’all there – it will be totally awesome!<br/>
(Sorry- I couldn’t resist the bad pun…)</p>
