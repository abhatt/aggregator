They're sophisticated and ground<br/>breaking, but I don't have the energy or time to read such long,<br/>complex papers.<br/><i>Dan:</i> I don't want them to be that way. It's accidental that they are so<br/>long. I just don't know when to give up. I keep going further and further<br/>into the problem until some solution comes, and sometimes it takes a<br/>hundred pages and years of work.<br/><br/><i>Claire:</i> But if many people are like me, then, having papers that are much<br/>longer than the norm, do you really think that that's a good marketing<br/>strategy?<br/><i>Dan:</i> Probably not. But enough people read them to satisfy me. Anyway, the<br/>way to go if you want to learn about the work I have done is not to read my<br/>papers. I find that the lecture notes format is much more<br/>satisfying. When I write a paper, I feel that somehow I have to state and<br/>prove the strongest result I have. When I teach, I give a weaker version<br/>that has a much simpler, shorter, more understandable proof, and that's<br/>what I put in my lecture notes, so that's what you should read. Also, later<br/>versions are usually quite a bit simpler.<br/><br/><i>Claire:</i> How do you choose research problems?<br/><i>Dan:</i> I find that I am attracted to problems that are hard. It's difficult<br/>for me to get motivated unless I have a sense that the problem is<br/>important; that's what keeps me going.<br/><br/><i>Claire:</i> But among all hard and important open problems, how do you know<br/>which one is a &quot;good&quot; problem?<br/><i>Dan:</i> It has to be a problem that gives me a lot of ideas, where I see a lot<br/>of possible connections with other areas, other subjects, where there are<br/>many angles that I want to explore, many papers to read and new things to<br/>learn. Then, along the way, I find that I am proving results on the side<br/>that are of interest in themselves. That's how I get a strong sense that<br/>it's a good problem to be working on.<br/><br/><i>Claire:</i> That seems to require a lot of experience. Is that how you picked<br/>problems when you were a graduate student?<br/><i>Dan:</i> No, you're right, of course that's not how I worked when I was a<br/>student. Then, I did the usual thing, you know, look around for hot topics<br/>on which there had recently been partial progress and new results had come<br/>out that were begging for improvements, and then I was able to find those<br/>improvements before professors just because I had a lot more time to devote<br/>to research than those professors.<br/><br/><i>Claire:</i> Do you think that you are a better researcher now than then?<br/><i>Dan:</i> yes, I think I am better at research. Although, I must admit that I<br/>have a lot less time for research, and, in particular, I no longer have<br/>time to keep up and read an insane number of papers, as I did when I was a<br/>student.<br/><br/><i>Claire:</i> At this point you're about mid-career. What do you want to do for<br/>the next half of your career?<br/><i>Dan:</i> That's a scary thought. I'm not really thinking about it. Right now I<br/>have projects that will keep me quite busy for the next few years, and by<br/>then, Â presumably I will have learned new things that will drive my<br/>research for the following few years, and so on. I do predict that I will<br/>be doing more and more programming.<br/><br/><i>Claire:</i> Do you see yourself as a mathematician or as a computer scientist?<br/><i>Dan:</i> I must say that there are many things mathematicians do that I do not<br/>get, in the sense that I have no clue <i>why</i> they work on those<br/>particular questions. I can read a Math paper and like its content very<br/>much, yet not have any idea why the author worked on that question. Maybe<br/>because someone else asked it before? It's a mystery to me. As for myself,<br/>I come to problems very much from the perspective of a computer science<br/>motivation.</div><div class="commentbar"><p/><span class="commentbutton" href="http://teachingintrotocs.blogspot.com/feeds/8568531802215753162/comments/default"/><a href="http://teachingintrotocs.blogspot.com/feeds/8568531802215753162/comments/default"><img class="commenticon" src="/images/feed-icon.png"/> Subscribe to comments</a><![CDATA[  | ]]><a href="http://teachingintrotocs.blogspot.com/2011/09/dan-spielman-on-research.html#comment-form"><img class="commenticon" src="/images/post-icon.png"/> Post a comment</a></div></content><updated planet:format="September 14, 2011 11:23 AM">2011-09-14T11:23:00Z</updated><published planet:format="September 14, 2011 11:23 AM">2011-09-14T11:23:00Z</published><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="TCS"/><author><name>Claire Mathieu</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/10957755706440077623</uri></author><source><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4068183698747623113</id><category term="TCS"/><category term="Oops"/><category term="technology"/><author><name>Claire Mathieu</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/10957755706440077623</uri></author><link href="http://teachingintrotocs.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#feed" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4068183698747623113/posts/default/-/TCS" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://teachingintrotocs.blogspot.com/search/label/TCS" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/" rel="hub" type="text/html"/><title>A CS Professor's blog</title><updated planet:format="August 31, 2018 11:03 AM">2018-08-31T11:03:02Z</updated><planet:module>toc</planet:module><planet:format>atom10</planet:format><planet:http_etag>W/&quot;8089cd57e1113cac488458ecc6b57d2f5d63c2f2cb0051d1de6e12d23ed12d82&quot;</planet:http_etag><planet:http_last_modified>Fri, 31 Aug 2018 11:03:02 GMT</planet:http_last_modified><planet:bozo>false</planet:bozo><planet:items_per_page>40</planet:items_per_page><planet:css-id>claire-mathieu</planet:css-id><planet:face>mathieu.jpeg</planet:face><planet:name>Claire Mathieu</planet:name><planet:filters>category.py?cats=tcs</planet:filters><planet:http_status>200</planet:http_status></source></entry>
