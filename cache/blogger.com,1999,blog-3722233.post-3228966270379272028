But 68? You don't look day over 66.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Bill: </b>Neither do you. But seriously, why do you think I'm 68?<br/>

<b>Lance: </b>I just Google'd &quot;How old is Bill Gasarch?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<b>Bill: </b>Don't believe everything you read on the Internet. I'm really 58.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Lance: </b>Prove it.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Bill: </b>Here's my driver's license.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Lance: </b>Bill you don't drive. And it literally says &quot;NOT A DRIVER'S LICENSE&quot; on the back. But it is an official State of Maryland Identification card stating that you were born in 1959. Are you saying I should trust the state of Maryland over Google?<br/>

Back to Dagstuhl. Let's talk about <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CPf_ocNIQJuhsnwG_6HKqaUDP8U-Pt7V8pJRLq6vvRw/edit?usp=sharing">the talks</a>. William Hoza gave a nice talk about hitting sets for L (deterministic small space) vs RL (randomized small space)  but when I asked him when will we prove L = RL he said not for fifty years. Grad students are not supposed to be that pessimistic.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Lance: </b>You mean realistic. Though I'd guess more like 10-20 years. I wouldn't even be surprised if NL (nondeterministic log space) = L.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Arpita Korwar: </b>I say 10-15 years.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Bill: </b>Can we put that in the blog?<br/>
<br/>
<b>Lance: </b>Too late. Bill I heard you were the stud muffin this week.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Bill: </b>Yes, I talked about the <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2018/06/the-muffin-problem.html">muffin problem</a>. Got a problem with that?<br/>
<br/>
<b>Lance: </b>Needed milk. I saw this talk two years ago and now you have cool theorems. Who would've thought if you have 24 muffins and 11 people you can allocate 24/11 muffins and the smallest piece is 19/44, and that's the best possible for maximizing the smallest piece.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Bill: </b>I can't believe you actually listened to the talk and didn't fall asleep.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Lance: </b>zzzzzz. Did you say something?<br/>
<br/>
<b>Bill: </b>Never mind. Eric Allender talked about the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.ITCS.2018.20">minimum circuit-size problem</a>: Given a truth-table of a function f is there a circuit for f less that a given size w. The problem is frustrated, just consider the following theorem: if MCSP is NP-complete then EXP does not equal ZPP (exponential time in zero-error probabilistic polynomial-time).<br/>
<br/>
<b>Lance: </b>Do you think EXP = ZPP?<br/>
<br/>
<b>Bill: </b>No, the result only tells us it will be hard to prove MSCP is NP-complete without informing us whether or not it is NP-complete. Allender did show that under projections it isn't NP-complete (Editor's Note: I should have said log-time projections see Eric's <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2018/09/still-typecasting-from-dagstuhl.html?showComment=1538032720983#c1629526917930788998">comment</a>. SAT and all your favorite NP-complete problems are complete under log-time projections). MSCP might be complete under poly-time reductions but not under weaker reductions.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Lance: </b>Reminds me of the Kolmogorov random strings that are hard for the halting for Turing reductions but not under many-one reductions.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Bill: </b>Everything reminds you of the Kolmogorov strings.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Lance: </b>As they should.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Bill: </b>I liked Michal Koucký's talk on <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.ESA.2018.12">Gray codes</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Lance: </b>Shouldn't that be grey codes. We're not in the UK.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Bill: </b>It's the color you moron. It's named after Frank Gray.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Lance: </b>You are smarter than you look, not bad for a 68 year old. I missed Koucký's talk due to a sports injury, but he did catch me up later.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Bill: </b>I never put Lance and sports in the same sentence before.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Lance: </b>And I never put Bill and driving together. It's a new day for everything. Koucký showed how to easily compute the next element in the Gray code querying few bits as long as the alphabet size is of size 3.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Bill: </b>Which contrasts Raskin's <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.ICALP.2017.88">2017 paper</a> that shows with a binary alphabet you need to query at least half the bits.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Lance: </b>Hey you stole my line.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Bill: </b>That's not possible. You are editing this. I think this typecast has gone long enough. Take us out.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Lance: </b>In a complex world, best to keep it simple.</div><div class="commentbar"><p/></div></summary><updated planet:format="September 27, 2018 06:44 AM">2018-09-27T06:44:00Z</updated><published planet:format="September 27, 2018 06:44 AM">2018-09-27T06:44:00Z</published><author><name>Lance Fortnow</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><source><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3722233</id><category term="typecast"/><category term="focs metacomments"/><author><name>Lance Fortnow</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><link href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><subtitle>Computational Complexity and other fun stuff in math and computer science from Lance Fortnow and Bill Gasarch</subtitle><title>Computational Complexity</title><updated planet:format="December 17, 2018 01:56 AM">2018-12-17T01:56:56Z</updated><planet:module>toc</planet:module><planet:format>atom10</planet:format><planet:http_etag>W/&quot;3c48828af0b9b548c409eba7b894fc342a0679ccd23a3f1db96c1212435d64c9&quot;</planet:http_etag><planet:http_last_modified>Sun, 16 Dec 2018 21:24:54 GMT</planet:http_last_modified><planet:bozo>false</planet:bozo><planet:items_per_page>40</planet:items_per_page><planet:css-id>computational-complexity</planet:css-id><planet:face>gasarch.png</planet:face><planet:name>Computational Complexity</planet:name><planet:http_status>200</planet:http_status></source></entry>
