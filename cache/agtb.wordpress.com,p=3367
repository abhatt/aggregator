<p><u>Committee:</u> Mohammad Akbarpour, Moshe Babaioff, Shengwu Li, and Ariel Procaccia</p>
<p>Following a new tradition started last year, the 2019 ACM Conference on Economics and Computation (EC’19) will host a special session highlighting some of the best work in economics and computation that appears in conferences and journals other than EC. The intention of this session is to expose EC attendees to related work just beyond the boundary of their current awareness.</p></div>

<div class="gmail_quote">We seek nominations for papers in Economics and Computation that have made breakthrough advances, opened up new questions or areas, made unexpected connections, or had significant impact on practice or other sciences. Examples of conferences and journals that publish papers relevant for the special session include STOC/FOCS/SODA/ITCS, AAAI/IJCAI/AAMAS, NIPS/ICML/COLT, WWW/KDD, AER/Econometrica/JPE/QJE/RESTUD/TE/AEJ Micro/JET/GEB, and Math of OR/Management Science/Operations Research. Anyone is welcome to contact us, but we especially invite members of PCs or editorial boards in various venues to send us suggestions.</div>
