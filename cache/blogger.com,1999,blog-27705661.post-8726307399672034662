I encourage all members of the community to nominate their favourite paper or small group of papers in logic and computation published within the past 25 years. </i><br/><br/><br/><span>The 2018 Alonzo Church Award for Outstanding Contributions to Logic and Computation </span><br/><span>Call for Nominations </span><br/><span>Introduction </span><br/><span>An annual award, called the Alonzo Church Award for Outstanding Contributions to Logic and Computation, was established in 2015 by the ACM Special Interest Group for Logic and Computation (SIGLOG), the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS), the European Association for Computer Science Logic (EACSL), and the Kurt Gödel Society (KGS). The award is for an outstanding contribution represented by a paper or by a small group of papers published within the past 25 years. This time span allows the lasting impact and depth of the contribution to have been established. The award can be given to an individual, or to a group of individuals who have collaborated on the research. For the rules governing this award, see: </span><span><a href="http://siglog.org/awards/alonzo-church-award/" style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;" target="_blank">http://siglog.org/awards/alonzo-church-award/</a>. </span><br/><span>The 2017 Alonzo Church Award was given jointly to Samson Abramsky, Radha Jagadeesan, Pasquale Malacaria, Martin Hyland, Luke Ong, and Hanno Nickau for providing a fully-abstract semantics for higher-order computation through the introduction of game models, see: </span><span><a href="http://siglog.org/winners-of-the-2017-alonzo-church-award/" style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;" target="_blank">http://siglog.org/winners-of-the-2017-alonzo-church-award/</a>. </span><br/><span>Eligibility and Nominations </span><br/><span>The contribution must have appeared in a paper or papers published within the past 25 years. Thus, for the 2018 award, the cut-off date is January 1, 1993. When a paper has appeared in a conference and then in a journal, the date of the journal publication will determine the cut-off date. In addition, the contribution must not yet have received recognition via a major award, such as the Turing Award, the Kanellakis Award, or the Gödel Prize. (The nominee(s) may have received such awards for other contributions.) While the contribution can consist of conference or journal papers, journal papers will be given a preference. </span><br/><span>Nominations for the 2018 award are now being solicited. The nominating letter must summarise the contribution and make the case that it is fundamental and outstanding. The nominating letter can have multiple co-signers. Self-nominations are excluded. Nominations must include: a proposed citation (up to 25 words); a succinct (100-250 words) description of the contribution; and a detailed statement (not exceeding four pages) to justify the nomination. Nominations may also be accompanied by supporting letters and other evidence of worthiness. </span><br/><span>Nominations should be submitted to </span><span><a href="mailto:catuscia@lix.polytechnique.fr" target="_blank">catuscia@lix.polytechnique.fr</a> </span><span>by </span><span><b>March 1, 2018</b></span><span>. </span><br/><span>Presentation of the Award</span><br/><span>The  2018 award will be presented at ICALP 2018, the International  Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming. The award will be  accompanied by an invited lecture by the award winner, or by one of the award winners. The awardee(s) will receive a  certificate and a cash prize of USD 2,000. If there are multiple awardees, this amount will be shared. </span><br/><span>Award Committee </span><br/><span>The 2018 Alonzo Church Award Committee consists of the following five members: Thomas Eiter, Javier Esparza, Catuscia Palamidessi (chair), Gordon Plotkin, and Natarajan Shankar. </span></div><div class="commentbar"><p/><span class="commentbutton" href="http://processalgebra.blogspot.com/feeds/8726307399672034662/comments/default"/><a href="http://processalgebra.blogspot.com/feeds/8726307399672034662/comments/default"><img class="commenticon" src="/images/feed-icon.png"/> Subscribe to comments</a><![CDATA[  | ]]><a href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=27705661&amp;postID=8726307399672034662"><img class="commenticon" src="/images/post-icon.png"/> Post a comment</a></div></content><updated planet:format="January 05, 2018 10:21 AM">2018-01-05T10:21:00Z</updated><published planet:format="January 05, 2018 10:21 AM">2018-01-05T10:21:00Z</published><author><name>Luca Aceto</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01092671728833265127</uri></author><source><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-27705661</id><author><name>Luca Aceto</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01092671728833265127</uri></author><link href="http://processalgebra.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#feed" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/27705661/posts/default" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://processalgebra.blogspot.com/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/" rel="hub" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/27705661/posts/default?start-index=26&amp;max-results=25" rel="next" type="application/atom+xml"/><subtitle>Papers I find interesting---mostly, but not solely, in Process Algebra---, and some fun stuff in Mathematics and Computer Science at large and on general issues related to research, teaching and academic life.</subtitle><title>Process Algebra Diary</title><updated planet:format="December 16, 2018 04:19 PM">2018-12-16T16:19:44Z</updated><planet:module>toc</planet:module><planet:format>atom10</planet:format><planet:http_etag>W/&quot;48f0fe25193a31ca0eb80ddb784c54ac8e96eb18f2285ecd00173dfc60536971&quot;</planet:http_etag><planet:http_last_modified>Sun, 16 Dec 2018 16:19:44 GMT</planet:http_last_modified><planet:bozo>false</planet:bozo><planet:items_per_page>40</planet:items_per_page><planet:css-id>luca-aceto</planet:css-id><planet:face>aceto.jpeg</planet:face><planet:name>Luca Aceto</planet:name><planet:http_status>200</planet:http_status></source></entry>
