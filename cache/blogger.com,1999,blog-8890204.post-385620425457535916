-- the work seems good-on-average.  Also, given the conference size, it seems well organized -- staff managing the people flow, they keep things on time, plenty of room in the poster session (with appropriate food and drink stuff).  I can appreciate the work that must go into to making something this big work.<br/><br/>Because the conference is so big, I've run into a good number of &quot;theory people&quot; here.  As a percentage of attendees, we're probably small, but it's a good number because it's so big.  I kept running into people at the poster sessions, which was nice.<br/><br/>The trade show part is impressive in its own way.  If you didn't know AI was big, this would tell you.  All the big players are there, but there are at least a dozen machine-learning focused companies I haven't heard of, and that's not including the dozen or more consulting/Wall Street/hedge fund firms that are big enough into AI that they want to have a presence here.  I understand there's lots of networking and pre-interviewing and interviewing going on.  On the positive side, I feel like if I wanted to leave academia, I could land a job with a variety of AI-based companies, beyond the big companies.    <br/><br/>Hopefully tomorrow will be interesting as well.<br/><br/><br/></div></content><updated planet:format="December 05, 2018 11:35 PM">2018-12-05T23:35:00Z</updated><published planet:format="December 05, 2018 11:35 PM">2018-12-05T23:35:00Z</published><author><name>Michael Mitzenmacher</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/02161161032642563814</uri></author><source><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8890204</id><category term="conferences"/><category term="research"/><category term="society"/><category term="algorithms"/><category term="administration"/><category term="teaching"/><category term="Harvard"/><category term="papers"/><category term="graduate students"/><category term="funding"/><category term="talks"/><category term="blogs"/><category term="codes"/><category term="jobs"/><category term="reviews"/><category term="personal"/><category term="travel"/><category term="undergraduate students"/><category term="books"/><category term="open problems"/><category term="PCs"/><category term="consulting"/><category term="randomness"/><category term="CCC"/><category term="blog book project"/><category term="research labs"/><category term="ISIT"/><category term="tenure"/><category term="comments"/><category term="recommendations"/><category term="outreach"/><category term="students"/><author><name>Michael Mitzenmacher</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/06738274256402616703</uri></author><link href="http://mybiasedcoin.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#feed" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8890204/posts/default" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://mybiasedcoin.blogspot.com/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/" rel="hub" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8890204/posts/default?start-index=26&amp;max-results=25" rel="next" type="application/atom+xml"/><subtitle type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">My take on computer science -- <br/>
