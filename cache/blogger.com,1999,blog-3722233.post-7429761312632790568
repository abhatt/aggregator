<br/>
you used to  get the following:   <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/bill68.png">here</a><br/>
<br/>
Please go there and notice how old they say I am.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, you are back. You may have noticed that they say I am 68. Gee, I don't feel 68 (I feel younger).<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea how Google got my age wrong.<br/>
<br/>
0) I found about this when I saw my age in an article about the Muffin problem. The article is <a href="https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2018/09/14/hoe-vijf-muffins-tot-een-diep-wiskundig-vraagstuk-leidden-a1616534">here</a>. I had been in contact with the author earlier so it was easy to contact him, assure him that I appreciate his throwing scammers and spammers off of my trail by giving me the wrong age, but I wondered why he chose 68. He then apologized (which was not needed) and pointed me to the google thing.<br/>
<br/>
1) My age was  not on my Wikipedia page. Nor was my birth year.<br/>
<br/>
2) I do not recall every telling Google my age -- but then again, Google knows what I search for and perhaps deduced an incorrect age from that (I've been watching a very old Western, Maverick, lately, which may have fooled them. So my plan is working!)<br/>
<br/>
3) Google thinks I published with Hilbert (see <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SVRgMwEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">here</a> or <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/05/google-scholar-thinks-my-hilbert-number.html">here</a>) so that would make them think I am 68 years old. Hmm, still to young. If I was a 10-year old math genius in 1938 (Hilbert died in 1943 but since I am not a 68 year old math genius I chose numbers to make it easy) and published with<br/>
him then, then I would now be 80. Not 68. So that is not the answer.<br/>
(Side question- are any of Hilbert's co-authors still alive?)<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, if anyone has any ideas why Google had it wrong, let me now<br/>
<br/>
4) Lance was outraged at this and hence put my birth year on my Wikipedia page thinking that<br/>
would fix it. (I was not outraged, just amused.)<br/>
<br/>
5) It was taken off my page since Lance couldn't prove it.<br/>
<br/>
6) Lance and I  mentioned my age in a blog post and that was proof enough. So our blog is a primary<br/>
source. We should use this sparingly -- with great power comes great responsibility. (See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fj7c3vBZ7jA">here</a> for more on that theme)<br/>
<br/>
7) Other weird internet stuff: What does it take to get a Wikipedia Page? A Nobel Prize in Physics<br/>
helps. See: <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/nobel-laureate-donna-strickland-judged-not-famous-enough-for-wikipedia-page-before-win-report">here</a>.<br/>
