So who's hiring in CS this year? Perhaps we should instead follow the advice of John Regehr.<br/>

I said this last year and it's time to say it again:<br/>
to save time and energy, will the CS departments NOT hiring faculty this year please speak up?</div>

For computer science faculty positions best to look at the ads from the <a href="http://www.cra.org/ads/">CRA</a> and the <a href="http://jobs.acm.org/">ACM</a>. For theoretical computer science specific postdoc and faculty positions check out <a href="https://cstheory-jobs.org/">TCS Jobs</a> and <a href="http://dmatheorynet.blogspot.com/">Theory Announcements</a>. If you have jobs to announce, please post to the above and/or feel free to leave a comment on this post.<br/>
<br/>
Even if you don't see an ad, almost surely your favorite university is looking to hire computer scientists. Check out their website or email someone at the department.<br/>
<br/>
And (selfish plug) Georgia Tech is <a href="https://www.scs.gatech.edu/content/cs-faculty-hiring">looking to hire in theory this year</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Some generally good advice: Make sure you have strong letter writers who know your research well, best if one or two of them come from outside your university. Put all your papers and materials on your website and make sure your Google Scholar page is accurate. Put effort into your job talk and remember you need to sell you research to non-theorists. Good if you can connect to other areas especially machine learning, data science or cybersecurity. Quantum seems hot this year.<br/>
<br/>
Above all have fun! In this computational and data driven world we live in, there is a great job out there for you.<br/></div><div class="commentbar"><p/></div></summary><updated planet:format="October 11, 2018 01:27 PM">2018-10-11T13:27:00Z</updated><published planet:format="October 11, 2018 01:27 PM">2018-10-11T13:27:00Z</published><author><name>Lance Fortnow</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><source><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3722233</id><category term="typecast"/><category term="focs metacomments"/><author><name>Lance Fortnow</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><link href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><subtitle>Computational Complexity and other fun stuff in math and computer science from Lance Fortnow and Bill Gasarch</subtitle><title>Computational Complexity</title><updated planet:format="December 17, 2018 01:56 AM">2018-12-17T01:56:56Z</updated><planet:module>toc</planet:module><planet:format>atom10</planet:format><planet:http_etag>W/&quot;3c48828af0b9b548c409eba7b894fc342a0679ccd23a3f1db96c1212435d64c9&quot;</planet:http_etag><planet:http_last_modified>Sun, 16 Dec 2018 21:24:54 GMT</planet:http_last_modified><planet:bozo>false</planet:bozo><planet:items_per_page>40</planet:items_per_page><planet:css-id>computational-complexity</planet:css-id><planet:face>gasarch.png</planet:face><planet:name>Computational Complexity</planet:name><planet:http_status>200</planet:http_status></source></entry>
