Well, I agree that it sounds like three changes â€” the point is that the more colocation the better :) In fact, I realized that I once again agree with Matt Welsh (who recently proposed a similar change for conferences in his community <a href="http://matt-welsh.blogspot.com/2015/05/a-modest-proposal-sosigcommobixdi.html">here</a>) which often happens when he takes a break from bashing academia.
Here are a few fairly straightforward reasons why I think colocation of multiple conferences at the same location and similar time is good:</p>
<ul>
<li> It has been tested and already works pretty well at FCRC. There are things that can happen at a scale of multiple communities that don't happen at the scale of just theory conferences. This year FCRC is hosting SPAA/EC/CCC as well as a few other conferences which might be of interest to theorists.
Possible synergies between different communities can be in the form of joint workshops, tutorials, keynotes, award lectures, etc. E.g., I hope that the <a href="http://grigory.us/mpc-workshop-fcrc.html">workshop on massively parallel algorithms</a> that I am co-organizing will benefit a lot from colocation with other conferences at FCRC. Overall, I am pretty sure these advantages are already fairly well understood. 
</li>
<li>Increased number of options among possible talks to attend. I am sure almost everyone has been in a situation when there is nothing interesting happening at their favorite conferences. I would personally much rather attend a great talk on a new topic I don't know much about (even if it is applied) than sit through a mediocre STOC/FOCS talk.
</li>
<li>
Less travel. Well, at a certain stage of their career I believe many of us would like to have to travel less. 
Now a more subtle aspect here is that there are conferences that I would really like to attend but I don't submit my papers there (e.g. EC, ICML, COLT), so I would really love to see them colocated with other conferences that I usually attend. 
</li>
<li>
No structural changes to the format of existing conferences. This eliminates all concerns associated with allocation of credit for publications, presentations, etc. thus ensuring backwards compatibility.
</li>
</ul>

<h1>What to colocate?</h1>
<p>A possible idea for colocation might be to change the set of colocated conferences in different years which creates a lot of opportunities.
Here are some concrete proposals and I am pretty sure you can come up with more:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>STOC+FOCS+...</b> Possible proposals for ... are: CCC, SPAA, PODC, EC, SOCG, ICALP, COLT, ICML, SIGMOD, PODS  since they happen around the same time. </li> 
&lt;/li&gt;
<li><b>SODA+ITCS</b>. I really try to attend both conferences whenever I can given that SODA and ITCS always happen back to back. Without colocation this always creates a seemingly unnecessary logistical overhead. In fact, I first heard this proposal from researchers at Google NYC who strongly supported it.
</li>
<li>
<b>Other conferences</b>. Some of the conferences that don't quite fit in given the time of the year when they usually happen but I would personally love to see colocated in some way: NIPS, VLDB, KDD, CIKM, WSDM, ICDM. I am pretty sure some people have their own list too (e.g. crypto conferences).
</li>
</ul>
