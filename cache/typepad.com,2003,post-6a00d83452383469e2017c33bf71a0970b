<blockquote><small>
<p>The Departments of <a href="http://cs.illinois.edu">Computer Science</a> (CS) and <a href="http://media.illinois.edu/advertising/">Advertising</a> (ADV) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign invite applications for a joint faculty position in <i>Computational Advertising.</i> This novel position is part of a new multi-year Strategic Excellence Hiring Program at Illinois that focuses on: (a) Information, Technology and Society, (b) Human Health and Wellness, (c) Energy and Sustainability, and (d) Culture, Communication, and Global Issues.  We seek candidates with CS skills in areas such as “big data”, data-mining, or algorithmic game theory, and with advertising interests or experience in areas such as online /contextual advertising, digital privacy, behavioral targeting, and social media analytics. Applications are encouraged from candidates whose research programs are in traditional as well as in nontraditional areas that would support novel research and teaching across the emerging discipline of Computational Advertising.  Each department is engaged in exciting new and expanding programs for research, education, and professional development, and each has strong ties to industry, across a wide landscape of technology and media partners.</p>

<p>Faculty in the CS department carry out research in a broad spectrum of areas and are supported by world-class facilities, starting with our department’s home in the Siebel Center for Computer Science, and including collaborations with the <a href="http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/">National Center for Supercomputing Applications</a>, the <a href="http://www.csl.illinois.edu/">Coordinated Science Laboratory</a>, the <a href="http://www.iti.illinois.edu/">Information Trust Institute</a>, and the <a href="http://www.informatics.uiuc.edu/">Illinois Informatics Institute</a>, as well as several industrial centers and programs that foster international collaborations. The CS department has one of the leading programs in the United States, granting approximately 200 B.S. degrees, 70 M.S. degrees, and 60 Ph.D. degrees annually.  The <a href="http://media.illinois.edu/advertising/">Department of Advertising</a>, the first such academic department in the country, was established in 1959 by Charles H. Sandage, considered to be the father of advertising education. Today, the top-ranked department celebrates Sandage's legacy with scholarship and teaching focused on understanding, evaluating and communicating the many facets of advertising. Approximately 150 B.S. degrees and 20 M.S. degrees are granted annually. Faculty can also teach in the <a href="http://media.illinois.edu/icr/">Institute for Communications Research</a> (ICR) doctoral program in the <a href="http://media.illinois.edu/">College of Media</a>.</p>
