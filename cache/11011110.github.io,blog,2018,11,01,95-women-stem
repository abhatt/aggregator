<p>I didn’t have to stretch much to find these; their claims to meeting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(academics)">Wikipedia’s notability standards for academics</a> (or in a few cases, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(people)#Creative_professionals">for authors</a>) are generally very clear. On top of the Strickland scandal (where a Wikipedia editor turned down a draft article on a future Nobelist despite her clearly meeting multiple criteria from that standard) I think this shows how many more deserving women there must still be that are not being properly recognized, and how much more work there still is to be done to recognize them.</p>
