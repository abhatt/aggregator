<p>As promised, an ad-hoc committee of theoretical computer scientists has been formed to <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~irani/safetoc.html">combat harassment and discrimination</a>.  Here is the committee's charter:</p>
<blockquote><small><em> &quot;We are setting an ad-hoc committee to draft a proposal for joint ToC measures to combat discrimination, harassment, bullying, and retaliation, and all matters of ethics that might relate to that. Proposed measures may include, but are not restricted to, coordinating policies and guidelines, and setting community-wide institutions for reporting and oversight. The primary goal should be a determination to deter and root out such behavior in the theory community. The issues of false reporting and due process should be taken into account. The committee is expected to conduct the necessary research on existing practices. The committee will submit a report to the appointing organizations by September 30, 2018.&quot;</em></small></blockquote>
<p>Members of the theory community (as broadly defined as you like) are <strong>strongly</strong> encouraged to contact any of the committee members with your input.</p>

<h3>TCS Women</h3>
<p>On June 26, as part of the STOC 2018 Theory Fest, <a href="https://cs-people.bu.edu/sofya/">Sofya Rashondnikova</a>, <a href="https://barnasaha.net/">Barna Saha</a>, and <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/virgi/">Virginia Vassilevska Williams</a> are organizing an inaugural meeting of <a href="https://tcswomen.wordpress.com/">TCS Women</a>, a new community for female researchers in theoretical computer science and related areas, aimed at providing networking and mentoring opportunities, and to help combat discrimination and make the theory community more welcoming to everyone.</p>
<p>The inaugural meeting will include a panel of distinguished theory researchers (with confirmed participants Nina Mishra, Ronitt Rubinfeld, and Virgnia Vassilevska Williams), a women's lunch, and a research rump session.</p>
<p><a href="https://tcswomen.wordpress.com/tcs-women-travel-scholarship/">Travel scholarships</a> are available for junior women researchers to attend STOC, thanks to generous support from Google, Microsoft, and NSF.  The <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfLISNcBULGBoOjvxW9llLJipHJOPuF5LbA5uLkLZ6L5Np4fg/viewform">application</a> deadline is May 10.</p>
