The programme is <a href="http://icetcs.ru.is/theory-day2018.html" target="_blank">here</a>.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.dais.is.tohoku.ac.jp/~tokuyama/profile_e.htm">Takeshi Tokuyama</a> (Tohoku University, Japan) kicked off the day with a talk entitled <i>Deformation of Determinants and Related Combinatorics</i>. The talk was based on work that Takeshi did in 1986 (as a mathematics postdoc) and <a href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jmath1948/40/4/40_4_671/_pdf" target="_blank">published in 1988</a>. He referred to it as his &quot;sleeping beauty&quot; as there has been a peak of interest in that paper <a href="https://scholar.google.is/citations?user=Kes_A4MAAAAJ&amp;hl=en#d=gs_md_cita-d&amp;p=&amp;u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DKes_A4MAAAAJ%26citation_for_view%3DKes_A4MAAAAJ%3AbuQ7SEKw-1sC%26tzom%3D-120" target="_blank">only  in the last ten years</a>. Takeshi's &quot;Weyl character formula&quot; was even the subject of a <a href="https://www.promys.org/research/2013" target="_blank">PROMYS research project in the summer of 2013</a>, which led to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.8139" target="_blank">a paper</a> that generalizes that formula to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall%E2%80%93Littlewood_polynomials" target="_blank">Hall-Littlewood polynomials</a>. The talk surveyed many interesting topics and connections with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_sign_matrix" target="_blank">alternating sign matrices</a>, computation of <a href="https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Boltzmann_weight" target="_blank">Boltzmann weights</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_base" target="_blank">crystal bases</a>.<br/><br/>The second half of the Theory Day 2018 was devoted to three short presentations by ICE-TCS researchers devoted to research highlights from the centre. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/antonisachilleos">Antonis Achilleos</a> set himself the goal of presenting two and a half years worth of research on monitorability, carried out within the framework of the <a href="http://icetcs.ru.is/theofomon/" target="_blank">TheoFoMon project</a>, in 15 minutes.<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ytigrani/"> Tigran Tonoyan</a> presented joint work with former ICE-TCS postdoc <a href="http://www.christiankonrad.de/" target="_blank">Christian Konrad</a> addressing the question of whether randomness helps in guessing the middle point of an on-line sequence. (Answer: It does.) Last, but not least, Christian Bean gave an overview of an <a href="https://ulfarsson.github.io/permuta_triangle/main_page.html" target="_blank">ongoing project</a> whose goal is to automate proofs of results in enumerative combinatorics. Christian presented many examples of published theorems, some of which from 2018, that can be established using their CombSpecSearcher algorithm and that were previously obtained using human ingenuity. <br/>  <br/>The Theory Day was preceded by a seminar by <a href="http://www.faculty.idc.ac.il/tami/">Tami Tamir</a> (Efi Arazi School of Computer Science, The Interdisciplinary Center) on Thursday, 23 August 2018. In her talk, Tami gave an excellent introduction to the main research questions in  algorithmic game theory, introduced <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/ec08-struct-holes.pdf" target="_blank">network formation games</a> and discussed her work with <a href="http://pub.ist.ac.at/~gavni/" target="_blank">Guy Avni</a> and <a href="http://cs.huji.ac.il/~ornak" target="_blank">Orna Kupferman</a> on automata formation games, where the goal of each player is given by a regular language rather than by simple reachability objectives. Tami focused on results presented in <a href="https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~ornak/publications/fossacs14a.pdf" target="_blank">this paper</a>, which were mostly of a negative nature. She concluded her informative and entertaining presentation by introducing her university, the E<a href="https://www.idc.ac.il/en/schools/cs/pages/home.aspx" target="_blank">fi Arazi School of Computer Science</a> and how they try to tackle the gender issues in computer science.<br/><br/>Overall, this was another good edition of the Theory Day at ICE-TCS. When we founded the centre on the 29th of April 2005, I had no idea that it would see so many installments of this event. I feel fortunate to have taken part in organizing them, to have worked with so many great colleagues in Iceland and to have met many very interesting and inspiring people along the way. Stay tuned for the Theory Day 2019, which will most likely be held in the spring of next year.<br/> </div><div class="commentbar"><p/><span class="commentbutton" href="http://processalgebra.blogspot.com/feeds/498772612905007972/comments/default"/><a href="http://processalgebra.blogspot.com/feeds/498772612905007972/comments/default"><img class="commenticon" src="/images/feed-icon.png"/> Subscribe to comments</a><![CDATA[  | ]]><a href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=27705661&amp;postID=498772612905007972"><img class="commenticon" src="/images/post-icon.png"/> Post a comment</a></div></content><updated planet:format="August 24, 2018 06:13 PM">2018-08-24T18:13:00Z</updated><published planet:format="August 24, 2018 06:13 PM">2018-08-24T18:13:00Z</published><author><name>Luca Aceto</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01092671728833265127</uri></author><source><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-27705661</id><author><name>Luca Aceto</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01092671728833265127</uri></author><link href="http://processalgebra.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#feed" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/27705661/posts/default" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://processalgebra.blogspot.com/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/" rel="hub" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/27705661/posts/default?start-index=26&amp;max-results=25" rel="next" type="application/atom+xml"/><subtitle>Papers I find interesting---mostly, but not solely, in Process Algebra---, and some fun stuff in Mathematics and Computer Science at large and on general issues related to research, teaching and academic life.</subtitle><title>Process Algebra Diary</title><updated planet:format="December 16, 2018 04:19 PM">2018-12-16T16:19:44Z</updated><planet:module>toc</planet:module><planet:format>atom10</planet:format><planet:http_etag>W/&quot;48f0fe25193a31ca0eb80ddb784c54ac8e96eb18f2285ecd00173dfc60536971&quot;</planet:http_etag><planet:http_last_modified>Sun, 16 Dec 2018 16:19:44 GMT</planet:http_last_modified><planet:bozo>false</planet:bozo><planet:items_per_page>40</planet:items_per_page><planet:css-id>luca-aceto</planet:css-id><planet:face>aceto.jpeg</planet:face><planet:name>Luca Aceto</planet:name><planet:http_status>200</planet:http_status></source></entry>
