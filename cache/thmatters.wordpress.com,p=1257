<p style="font-weight: 400;">Besides service to the community, there are many other benefits from serving:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s an opportunity to meet a lot of people in one’s own field and others, and to become more well-known in research communities. Some institutions place value on the experience. Many rotators are able to use it to enhance career options.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">A rotator can typically spend 20% (NSF-paid) time on research, including visits back to the home institution. The impact on research and advising may be considerable, but does not have to be a complete hiatus.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a wealth of opportunities for cultural and educational experiences for families who relocate to the area for a few years, which some find to offset the very considerable impacts associated with such a move.</span></li>
</ul>
