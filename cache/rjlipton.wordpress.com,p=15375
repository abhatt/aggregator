Elizabeth Croft is Dean of Engineering at Monash University in Australia. She was previously at the University of British Columbia in Canada and was the BC and Yukon Chair for Women in Science and Engineering. </p>
<p>
Today Ken and I want to discuss barriers to gender equity in computer science.<br/>
<span id="more-15375"/></p>
<p>
Our central thesis is: <em>One of the problems that makes it hard to attract women researchers is an environment of countless micro barriers</em>. This is also the position in an <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/workplace/masculine-culture-and-micro-barriers-still-major-issues-for-women-20180212-p4z00s.html">article</a> that Croft wrote earlier this year for the Sydney Morning Herald. The article is titled, “Masculine culture and micro barriers still major issues for women.” It argues that fundamental improvements in equity for STEM areas will come only after a change in culture. </p>
<p>
Croft’s article includes several specific recommendations for universities and related institutions—we abbreviate those after the first:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Start by increasing female representation in the STEM workforce and in university science and engineering departments, creating relatable role models for young women. If they see it, they’ll know they can “be” it. <p/>
</li><li>
Check implicit bias. Everyone harbours implicit biases, but [employers must be] aware of how [biases] can affect their decision making. <p/>
</li><li>
Collect data on salary, recruitment, promotion, retention and leadership. <p/>
</li><li>
Support and implement people-friendly policies. <p/>
</li><li>
Raise awareness among young women about STEM-related fields and careers.
</li></ol>
<p>
All these are laudable, and articles like <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/bob-ramsay/gender-parity-dominance_b_9660436.html">this</a> show some progress, but there’s a distinction. Items 3, 4, and to a large extent 2 can be handled by “macro” measures: employment policies; pay equity standards; provision of personal leave and child care; family-friendly scheduling; bias-awareness training. Item 5, however, is “micro” and so really is 1. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Micro Barriers 1 </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The micro-barrier thesis has two further implications. One is known but insidious; the other we feel is often missed. Both are effects of the culture referenced above but on the widest of scales.</p>
<p>
To show the first effect, we searched “tech startups” without quotes on Google Images. Many hits are icons of companies or diagrams but some are photos of real people. Here is a collage of the first hits seen with people, not counting two advertisements with a man on a ladder and several showing hands that are clearly male:</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/techstartupcollage.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-15377" height="150" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/techstartupcollage.png?w=566&amp;h=150" width="566"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
To be fair, in the next five hits is a photo from an <a href="https://www.un.org/africarenewal/magazine/august-november-2018/women-led-tech-startups-rise-africa">article</a> on women-led tech startups in Africa. Now here are the top results for “computer science graduates”:</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/computersciencegraduates.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-15378" height="145" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/computersciencegraduates.png?w=600&amp;h=145" width="600"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
The middle item in the top row is a stock <a href="https://de.dreamstime.com/lizenzfreies-stockbild-globales-computernetz-image16916446">image</a>. Again to be fair, hits 11–30 showed more balance—as did searches on “computer science students” and “computer science graduate students.” </p>
<p>
The broadcast reality remains that of a heavily male field. The reasons given <a href="https://www.computerscience.org/resources/women-in-computer-science/#the-current-state-of-women-in-computer-science">here</a> for “why aren’t more women involved in CS?” trace the dropoff to the advent of micro PCs as ‘boy toys’ in the 1980s. We agree with that origin. What we have now, unfortunately, adds a layer of self-perpetuation from the images that young people see. </p>
<p>
The same degree of male pervasion shows up in <a href="https://blog.conceptnet.io/posts/2017/conceptnet-numberbatch-17-04-better-less-stereotyped-word-vectors/">language</a> too. Is there a fix that doesn’t feel like trying to contain the sea? </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Micro Barriers 2 </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The second effect is how the culture plays into male expectations in ways invisible to many, even to those who are champions of diversity. We feel we can best express this with a few examples from women’s groups themselves. Then it is clear that no harm was intended. We don’t mean to criticize, just raise some more awareness. We offer questions without having ideas for even half the answers.</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<b>A Picture</b></p>
<p>
Let’s look at a <a href="https://www.sigarch.org/gender-diversity-in-computer-architecture/">site</a> for diversity in computer architecture. The site starts with the following picture:</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/architecturewoman.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-15379" height="250" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/architecturewoman.png?w=400&amp;h=250" width="400"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
Then it adds: “In part one of our series on gender diversity within the subdiscipline of computer architecture, we present some data that provides signal on where our community stands today with respect to gender diversity.” So the purpose following the picture is clear, but here are our questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
The woman in the picture is a beautiful model in high heels. What does appearance have to do with research? Does this help to advance diversity? <p/>
</li><li>
She is lifting a curtain on a microchip and holding a megaphone. Is this meant to symbolize proclaiming a new career opportunity for those who would otherwise go into business or modeling? <p/>
</li><li>
It is a stock artwork with many <a href="https://es.123rf.com/photo_56275500_mujer-joven-con-megafono-en-traje-de-negocios-cortina-de-color-de-apertura.html">variations</a>. <a href="https://www.zeitraum-gruppe.de/">Here</a> in Germany it advertises a five-point plan for taking a business digital; <a href="http://tneg.com.br/produto/oac-conversoes-e-operacoes-aritmeticas-com-binarios-fase-1/">here</a> in Brazil it advertises an online intro course in computer architecture. Is it just that the picture is universally recognized as an emblem of computer architecture as a field? <p/>
</li><li>
Is the glamour and cleanness simply a net positive? Does it induce male readers who see the page to read the text below? Or, not?
</li></ol>
<p/><p><br/>
<b>A Quote</b></p>
<p>
We all like to add quotes to enhance our web sites—we do that all the time here at GLL. The TCS Women <a href="https://tcswomen.wordpress.com">site</a> is for advancing diversity in theoretical computer science. The front page starts with their mission statement and immediately transitions to an infamous sexist quote in mathematics:</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/tcswomenwithquote.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-15380" height="260" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/tcswomenwithquote.png?w=400&amp;h=260" width="400"/></a></p>
<p>
The quotation is known from the <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/mathematics/recreational-mathematics/littlewoods-miscellany">book</a> <em>A Mathematician’s Miscellany</em> by John Littlewood, who thought nothing of appending the parenthetical explanation “(She was very plain).” Again we have some questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Is it clear to readers that this is meant to call out sexism—in a way that can’t be confused with the gender-free ideal of the previous sentence? (Nothing follows it except a meeting announcement.) <p/>
</li><li>
Is this the right context to make a point that Noether’s appearance had nothing to do with her brilliant research? <p/>
</li><li>
Is the quote meant to do all these things and also provoke amusement?
</li></ol>
<p>
My reaction was confusion on the first and second point both. Ken’s is that he finds both the quotation and its juxtaposition funny—but in a way that may be “manfunny.” In either case we fear it is giving too quick shrift to male preoccupations when great female achievements could be hailed in that place instead.</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<b>A Word</b></p>
<p>
The term “badass” has recently emerged as a goal-word for women in tech. The original pejorative male-rooted meaning has turned around to describe women as strong, assertive, formidable, no-nonsense. An example of its embrace is the 2016 <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=6WGkCgAAQBAJ">book</a> <em>My Badass Book of Saints: Courageous Women Who Showed Me How to Live</em>. For many female achievers this is great, and we applaud them, but we have questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Might there be many more women for whom the appellation is a turn-off? <p/>
</li><li>
Is it holding women up to a male referent? To underscore this point, the word “badass” was used in the NY Times Sunday Oct. 21 crossword puzzle with the <a href="https://nytcrosswordanswers.com/131841/total-baller-crossword-clue/">clue</a> “total baller.”
</li></ol>
<p>
The whole situation calls to mind Pogo Possum’s famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_have_met_the_enemy">saying</a>: “We have met the enemy, and he is us.”</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Plural Culture </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
There are of course other aspects of the culture that are more overt. There are micro-aggressions exemplified by back-handed compliments (“you code well for a girl”) and widening criticism of a female colleague to the whole gender. Three female computer science students at MIT in 2014 discovered a self-perpetuating aspect of the culture, in that the audience for their “ask me anything” <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/12/mit-scientists-on-women-in-stem/">forum</a>  behaved in a way that exceeded what Croft terms a “locker room” in the Monash interview linked under her photo at top. So we are brought back to the main question:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> What can be done to change the culture? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The one suggestion we’ve come up with is to recognize this as really the problem of achieving a <em>plural culture</em> in a smaller community. The meaning of <em>diversity</em> should refer not just to the community’s composition but to the recognition of diverse ways to be effective and succeed. </p>
<p>
This is of course hard. In academia a computer science department is smaller and more uniform than the university as a whole. On the scale of a university, diversity of ways translates most readily to diversity of majors—and starting from a computer science context, that means away from CS. So the challenge is to create a diversity of norms for success without cutting away from the common course structure and grading standards. </p>
<p>
As for how to achieve this, at this point we have only analogies. One comes from Ken’s take on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean's_8">movie</a> <em>Ocean’s Eight</em>, which is that the director Gary Ross and his co-writer Olivia Milch diverged from a straight emulation of the all-male “Rat Pack” in the previous “Ocean’s” movies. They were interviewed in an <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2018/06/oceans-8-screenwriter-olivia-milch-actresses-1201970445/">article</a> that uses “badass” in its title but the qualities that emerge are described at the end as “relatable.” On Ken’s viewing, the eight women succeed more through their own culture than by adopting male culture.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Ken and I could go on with further examples of such micro barriers. Many focus on appearance, some on other issues. All are small issues. They are not extreme statements like: women should be <img alt="{\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\dots}"/> </p>
<p>
But I do wonder whether the barriers accumulate. Do they accumulate and tip the scales toward having fewer women in computer science. What do you think?</p>
<p>
By the way we at GLL are well aware that most of our readers are male. I wish we could change that but oh well.</p>
