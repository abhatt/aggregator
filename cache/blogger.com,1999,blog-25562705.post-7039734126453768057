One of the targeted areas is machine learning and economics. Whoever takes this position will join a growing group of exceptional postdocs in this area at Penn, including Jamie Morgenstern and Bo Waggoner.<br/><br/><br/><br/><pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Postdoctoral Position in Machine Learning at UPenn<br/><br/>Applications are invited for a postdoctoral position in machine learning  in the Department of Computer and Information Science at the University  of Pennsylvania. The position is expected to begin in Fall 2016, and is  for a period of up to two years (with renewal in the second year  contingent on performance in the first year). Applications in all areas  of machine learning will be considered, with special emphasis on the  following areas: ranking and choice modeling; connections between machine learning and economics; and learning of complex structures.<br/><br/>The ideal candidate will demonstrate both ability for independent  thinking and interest in co-mentoring of graduate students. The candidate will work primarily with Shivani Agarwal (joining UPenn faculty in July 2016), but will also have opportunities to collaborate with other faculty in machine learning and related areas at UPenn, including Michael Kearns, Daniel Lee, Sasha Rakhlin, Aaron Roth, Lyle Ungar, and other faculty.<br/><br/>UPenn is located in the vibrant city of Philadelphia, which is known for its rich culture, history, museums, parks, and restaurants. It is less than 1.5 hrs by train to NYC, 1.5 hrs by flight to Boston, 2 hrs by train to Washington DC, and 40 mins by train to Princeton.
