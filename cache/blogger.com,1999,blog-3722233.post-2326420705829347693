Oh well.<br/>
<br/>
It has been said that this midterm election (more than others) was a referendum on the prez.  Every prez election year I have my students (or someone's students) vote (Secret Ballot of course) for president. ((see <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2016/11/and-winner-is-harambe.html">2016</a> , <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2012/11/random-thoughts-on-election.html">2012</a>, <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2012/11/random-thoughts-on-election.html">2008</a>) This year, for the first time, I had a midterm election, though rather than ask them which Maryland people they would vote for, I made it truly a referendum on Trump by asking two questions:<br/>
<br/>
1) Who did you vote for in 2016?<br/>
<br/>
2) Knowing what you know now, who would have have voted for in 2016?<br/>
<br/>
Full Disclosure: I am in the Clinton/Clinton Camp. However, this is an information-post not an opinion-post, so my vote is not relevant nor was it counted.<br/>
<br/>
I give the full results at the end of the post; however, I will summarize the most interesting data: the change-mind people and my thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
4 voted Trump and now wish they voted differently: Harmabe, Clinton, Nobody, Gasarch<br/>
<br/>
Only 12 people had voted for Trump in 2016 and of those 4<br/>
regret it. While I can see wanting Clinton, Nobody, or Gasarch,<br/>
I'm surprised someone wanted Harmabe. Is he even a citizen?<br/>
<br/>
5 voted Clinton and now wish they voted differently: 2-Johnson, Trump, Kanye, Gasarch.<br/>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Since Clinton hasn't done anything to merit rejection since the election,</div>
<div>
I deduce these people are more going TOWARDS the one they picked rather</div>
<div>
than AWAY from her. Trump has been Prez and has done stuff, so Clinton/Trump</div>
<div>
makes sense -- the student's opinion is that Trump is doing better</div>
<div>
than expected. Gary Johnson hasn't done anything to merit a change towards</div>
<div>
him, so thats a puzzler.  Kanye, similar. As for Gasarch, if the reasoning</div>
<div>
is `he's doing a good job teaching crypto, lets make him president' doesn't</div>
<div>
really work since he's not doing THAT good a job. If it was Ramsey theory</div>
<div>
then I could see it.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Misc:</div>
<div>
1 Underwood(House of Cards)/Satan (For those tired of picking the LESSER of two evils)</div>
<div>
1 Stein/Clinton</div>
<div>
1 Johnson/Clinton</div>
<div>
1 Kruskal/Gasarch (some people can't tell them apart)</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
The two who went to Clinton I interpret as thinking Trump is worse</div>
<div>
than expected.<br/>
<br/>
ALSO: Hillary had 28 Hillary/Hillary. Hence Trump had the largest percentage of people who regret voting for him, but still only 1/3. And the numbers are to small to make much of them.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
MY OPINON: FORTNOW in 2020!</div>

TWO people who voted third party now would have voted Clinton.</div>
<div>
I interpret this as not-liking-Trump since I don't think Clinton</div>
<div>
has done anything since the election to make anyone thing better</div>
<div>
or worse of her, while as Trump as president has done enough</div>
<div>
to change people's opinions of him.</div>
