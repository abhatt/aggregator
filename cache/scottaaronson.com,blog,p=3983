<p>FiveThirtyEight currently gives <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beto_O%27Rourke">Beto O’Rourke</a> a ~29% chance of winning Ted Cruz’s Senate seat.  I wish it were higher, but I think this will be such a spectacular upset if it happens, and so transformative for Texas, that it’s well worth our support.  I’ve also been impressed by the enthusiasm of Beto’s campaign—including a rally in Austin this weekend where the 85-year-old Willie Nelson, headlining the first political event of his 60-year music career, performed a new song (<a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/10/01/willie-nelson-beto-orourke-song-sot-es-vpx.cnn">“Vote ‘Em Out”</a>).  I’ll tell you what: if anyone <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/betofortexas-ads-ms-gl">donates</a> to Beto’s campaign within the next two days as a result of reading this post, and emails or leaves a comment to tell me about it, I’ll match their donation, up to my personal <a href="https://www.iqoqi-vienna.at/en/blog/article/boris-tsirelson/">Tsirelson bound</a> of $853.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, if you’re a US citizen and are not currently registered to vote, please do so!  And then show up and vote in the midterms!  My personal preference is to treat voting as simply a categorical imperative.  But if you’d like a mathematical discussion of the expected utility of voting, then check out <a href="https://www.skishore.me/voting.html">this</a>, by my former MIT undergraduate advisee Shaunak Kishore.</p>
<p>But what about the <em>highest</em> questions currently facing the American republic: namely, the exact meanings of “boofing,” “Devil’s triangle,” and “Renate alumnius”?  I’ve been reading the same articles and analyses as everybody else, and have no privileged insight.  For what it’s worth, though, I think it’s likely that Blasey Ford is teling the truth.  And I think it’s likely that Kavanaugh is lying—if not about the assault itself (which he might genuinely have no memory of—blackout is a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/29/opinion/sunday/brett-kavanaugh-drinking-blackouts.html">real phenomenon</a>), then certainly about his teenage drinking and other matters.  And while, absent some breakthrough in the FBI investigation, none of this rises to the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard, I think it likely <em>should</em> be seen as disqualifying for the Supreme Court.  (Admittedly, I’m not a good arbiter of that question, since there are about 200 unrelated reasons why I don’t want Kavanaugh near the Court.)  I also think it’s perfectly reasonable of Senate Democrats to fight this one to the bitter end, particularly after what the Republicans did to Merrick Garland, and what Kavanaugh himself did to Bill Clinton.  If you’re worried about the scorched-earth, all-defect equilibrium that seems to prevail in Congress—well, the Democrats are not the ones who started it.</p>
<p>All of that would be one thing, coming from some hardened social-justice type who might have happily convicted Kavanaugh of aggravated white male douchiness even before his umbilical cord was cut.  But I daresay that it means a bit more, coming from an individual who hundreds of online activists once denounced just as fervently as they now denounce Kavanaugh—someone who understands perfectly well that not even the <em>allegation</em> of wrongdoing is needed any longer for a person to be marked for flattening by the steamroller of Progress.  What can I say?  The enemy of my enemy is sometimes still my enemy.  My friend is anybody, of whatever party or creed, who puts their humanity above their ideology.  Justice is no respecter of persons.  Sometimes those who earn the mob’s ire are nevertheless guilty.</p>
<p>I was actually in the DC area the week of the Kavanaugh hearings, to speak at a quantum information panel on Capitol Hill convened by the House Science Committee, to participate in a <a href="http://qml2018.umiacs.io/">quantum machine learning workshop</a> at UMD, and to deliver the <a href="https://afods.org/nathan-krasnopoler/">Nathan Krasnopoler</a> Memorial Lecture at Johns Hopkins, which included the incredibly moving experience of meeting Nathan’s parents.</p>
<p>The panel went fine, I think.  Twenty or thirty Congressional staffers attended, including many of those involved in the <a href="https://science.house.gov/sites/republicans.science.house.gov/files/documents/NationalQuantumInitiativeActOnePager.pdf">National Quantum Initiative</a> bill.  They asked us about the US’s standing relative to China in QIS; the relations among academia, industry, and national labs; and how to train a ‘quantum workforce.’  We panelists came prepared with a slide about what qubits and interference are, but ended up never needing it: the focus was emphatically on policy, not science.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris">Kamala Harris</a> (D-CA) is the leader in the Senate for what’s now called the Quantum Computing Research Act.  One of Sen. Harris’s staffers conveyed to me that, given her great enthusiasm for quantum computing, the Senator would have been delighted to meet with me, but was unfortunately too busy with Kavanaugh-related matters.  This was better than what I’d feared, namely: “following the lead of various keyboard warriors on Twitter and Reddit, Sen. Harris denounces you, Dr. Aaronson, as a privileged white male techbro and STEMlord, and an enemy of the people.”  So once again I was face-to-face with the question: is it conceivable that social-media discourse is a bit … unrepresentative of the wider world?</p></div></content><updated planet:format="October 02, 2018 03:59 PM">2018-10-02T15:59:48Z</updated><published planet:format="October 02, 2018 03:59 PM">2018-10-02T15:59:48Z</published><category scheme="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog" term="Adventures in Meatspace"/><category scheme="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog" term="Announcements"/><category scheme="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog" term="The Fate of Humanity"/><author><name>Scott</name><uri>http://www.scottaaronson.com</uri></author><source><id>https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?feed=atom</id><link href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?feed=atom" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><subtitle xml:lang="en-US">The Blog of Scott Aaronson</subtitle><title xml:lang="en-US">Shtetl-Optimized</title><updated planet:format="December 12, 2018 11:39 AM">2018-12-12T11:39:08Z</updated><planet:module>toc</planet:module><planet:format>atom10</planet:format><planet:http_etag>&quot;f6ed79677f950a377f97902945f4c3e7&quot;</planet:http_etag><planet:http_last_modified>Wed, 12 Dec 2018 11:39:08 GMT</planet:http_last_modified><planet:bozo>false</planet:bozo><planet:items_per_page>40</planet:items_per_page><planet:css-id>scott-aaronson</planet:css-id><planet:face>aaronson.jpeg</planet:face><planet:name>Scott Aaronson</planet:name><planet:http_location>https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?feed=atom</planet:http_location><planet:http_status>301</planet:http_status></source></entry>
