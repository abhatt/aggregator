<p>My account is <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/aaron_sterling">@aaron_sterling</a>, and you can see it in the rightmost column of this blog.  Here are three items that are good examples of things I found interesting, but which, after today, I won’t be “elevating” to the status of a blog entry.</p>
<ol>
<li>The computer security company McAfee has produced a document titled <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/reports/rp-threat-predictions-2012.pdf">2012 Threat Predictions</a> (pdf file).  I skipped over some of it, but the parts I read were fascinating.  For example, they see BitCoin as an extremely insecure currency, they believe illegal spam will diminish and be replaced by “legal spam” (equally annoying), and they think far more attackers will target hardware exploits instead of the traditional software exploits.  Worth a look.</li>
<li>Enrique Zabala has produced <a href="http://www.cs.bc.edu/~straubin/cs381-05/blockciphers/rijndael_ingles2004.swf">a Flash animation</a> that explains Rijndael/AES visually.  It is beautiful.</li>
<li>Rajarshi Guha and co-authors are designing <a href="http://blog.rguha.net/?p=993">a type-ahead chemical substructure search engine</a>.  This addresses a longstanding open problem in cheminformatics, which is: searching for chemicals in a database is slow (in worst case probably exponential because the Subgraph Isomorphism Problem is NP-complete), but can it be made faster?  At least for important special cases, this tool seems to be competitive in speed with Google’s type-ahead search engine for other content: it provides the chemist suggestions, given the prefix of the input available, before the chemist even hits the enter key.</li>
