different sequence models.  Although recurrent neural networks were once the
tool of choice, now models like the autoregressive
<a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/">Wavenet</a> or the
<a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/transformer-novel-neural-network.html">Transformer</a>
are replacing RNNs on a diverse set of tasks. In this post, we explore the
trade-offs between recurrent and feed-forward models. Feed-forward models can
offer improvements in training stability and speed, while recurrent models are
strictly more expressive. Intriguingly, this added expressivity does not seem to
boost the performance of recurrent models.  Several groups have shown
feed-forward networks can match the results of the best recurrent models on
benchmark sequence tasks. This phenomenon raises an interesting question for
theoretical investigation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When and why can feed-forward networks replace recurrent neural networks
without a loss in performance?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We discuss several proposed answers to this question and highlight our
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10369">recent work</a> that offers an explanation in
terms of a fundamental stability property.</p>

<h1 id="a-tale-of-two-sequence-models">A Tale of Two Sequence Models</h1>
<h2 id="recurrent-neural-networks">Recurrent Neural Networks</h2>
<p>The many variants of recurrent models all have a similar form. The model
maintains a state $h_t$ that summarizes the past sequence of inputs. At each
time step $t$, the state is updated according to the equation
[
    h_{t+1} = \phi(h_t, x_t),
]
where $x_t$ is the input at time $t$, $\phi$ is a differentiable map, and $h_0$
is an initial state. In a vanilla recurrent neural network, the model is
parameterized by matrices $W$ and $U$, and the state is updated according to
[
    h_{t+1} = \tanh(Wh_t + Ux_t).
]
In practice, the <a href="http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/">Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM)</a> network is
more frequently used. In either case, to make predictions, the state is passed
to a function $f$, and the model predicts $y_t = f(h_t)$. Since the state $h_t$
is a function of all of the past inputs $x_0, \dots, x_t$, the prediction $y_t$
depends on the entire history $x_0, \dots, x_t$ as well.</p>

<p>A recurrent model can also be represented graphically.</p>

</p>

<p>Recurrent models are fit to data using backpropagation. However, backpropagating
gradients from time step $T$ to time step $0$ often requires infeasibly large
amounts of memory, so essentially every implementation of a recurrent model
<em>truncates</em> the model and only backpropagates gradient $k$ times steps.</p>

<p>In this setup, the predictions of the recurrent model still depend on the entire
history $x_0, \dots, x_T$. However, it’s not clear how this training procedure
affects the model’s ability to learn long-term patterns, particularly those that
require more than $k$ steps.</p>

<h2 id="autoregressive-feed-forward-models">Autoregressive, Feed-Forward Models</h2>
<p>Instead of making predictions from a state that depends on the entire history,
an autoregressive model directly predicts $y_t$ using only the $k$ most recent
inputs, $x_{t-k+1}, \dots, x_{t}$. This corresponds to a strong <em>conditional
independence</em> assumption. In particular, a feed-forward model assumes the target
only depends on the $k$ most recent inputs. Google’s
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03499">WaveNet</a> nicely illustrates this general
principle.</p>

<p>In contrast to an RNN, the limited context of a feed-forward model means that it
cannot capture patterns that extend more than $k$ steps. However, using
techniques like dilated-convolutions, one can make $k$ quite large.</p>

<h1 id="why-care-about-feed-forward-models">Why Care About Feed-Forward Models?</h1>
<p>At the outset, recurrent models appear to be a strictly more flexible and
expressive model class than feed-forward models. After all, feed-forward
networks make a strong conditional independence assumption that recurrent models
don’t make. Even if feed-forward models are less expressive, there are still
several reasons one might prefer a feed-forward network.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Parallelization</strong>: Convolutional feed-forward models are easier to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03122">parallelize
at training time</a>. 
There’s no hidden state to update and maintain, and
therefore no sequential dependencies between outputs. This allows very
efficient implementations of training on modern hardware.</li>
  <li><strong>Trainability</strong>: Training deep convolutional neural networks is the
bread-and-butter of deep learning. Whereas recurrent models are often more
finicky and difficult to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.5063">optimize</a>,
significant effort has gone into designing architectures and software to
efficiently and reliably train deep feed-forward networks.</li>
  <li><strong>Inference Speed</strong>: In some cases, feed-forward models can be significantly
more light-weight and perform <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.5063">inference faster than similar recurrent
systems</a>. In other cases,
particularly for long sequences, autoregressive inference is a large
bottleneck and requires <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07825">significant engineering
work</a> or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10433">significant
cleverness</a> to overcome.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="feed-forward-models-can-outperform-recurrent-models">Feed-Forward Models Can Outperform Recurrent Models</h1>
<p>Although it appears trainability and parallelization for feed-forward models
comes at the price of reduced accuracy, there have been several recent examples
showing that feed-forward networks can actually achieve the same accuracies as
their recurrent counterparts on benchmark tasks.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Language Modeling.</strong>
In language modeling, the goal is to predict the next word in a document given
all of the previous words. Feed-forward models make predictions using only the
$k$ most recent words, whereas recurrent models can potentially use the entire
document.  The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08083">Gated-Convolutional Language
Model</a> is a feed-forward autoregressive models
that is competitive with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02410">large LSTM baseline
models</a>. Despite using a truncation length of
$k=25$, the model outperforms a large LSTM on the
<a href="https://einstein.ai/research/the-wikitext-long-term-dependency-language-modeling-dataset">Wikitext-103</a>
benchmark, which is designed to reward models that capture long-term
dependencies. On the <a href="http://www.statmt.org/lm-benchmark/">Billion Word
Benchmark</a>, the model is slightly worse
than the largest LSTM, but is faster to train and uses fewer resources.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Machine Translation.</strong>
The goal in machine translation is to map sequences of English words to
sequences of, say, French words. Feed-forward models make translations using
only $k$ words of the sentence, whereas recurrent models can leverage the entire
sentence.  Within the deep learning world, variants of the LSTM-based <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473">Sequence
to Sequence with Attention</a> model, particularly
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08144">Google Neural Machine Translation</a>, were
superseded first by a fully <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03122">convolutional sequence to
sequence</a> model and then by the
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">Transformer</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote" href="http://www.offconvex.org/feed.xml#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Speech Synthesis.</strong>
In speech synthesis, one seeks to generate a realistic human speech signal.
Feed-forward models are limited to the past $k$ samples, whereas recurrent
models can use the entire history. Upon publication, the feed-forward,
autoregressive <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03499">WaveNet</a> was a substantial
improvement over LSTM-RNN parametric models.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Everthing Else.</strong> 
Recently <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01271">Bai et al.</a> proposed a generic
feed-forward model leveraging dilated convolutions and showed it outperforms
recurrent baselines on tasks ranging from synthetic copying tasks to music
generation.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="how-can-feed-forward-models-outperform-recurrent-ones">How Can Feed-Forward Models Outperform Recurrent Ones?</h1>
<p>In the examples above, feed-forward networks achieve results on par with or
better than recurrent networks. This is perplexing since recurrent models
seem to be more powerful a priori. One explanation for this phenomenon is
given by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08083">Dauphin et al.</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The unlimited context offered by recurrent models is not strictly necessary
for language modeling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, it’s possible you don’t need a large amount of context to do
well on the prediction task on average. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02526">Recent theoretical
work</a> offers some evidence in favor of this view.</p>

<p>Another explanation is given by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01271">Bai et al.</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The “infinite memory” advantage of RNNs is largely absent in practice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Bai et al. report, even in experiments explicitly requiring long-term
context, RNN variants were unable to learn long sequences. On the Billion Word
Benchmark, an <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10724">intriguing Google Technical
Report</a> suggests an LSTM $n$-gram model with
$n=13$ words of memory is as good as an LSTM with arbitrary context.</p>

<p>This evidence leads us to conjecture: <strong>Recurrent models <em>trained in practice</em>
are effectively feed-forward.</strong> This could happen either because truncated
backpropagation time cannot learn patterns significantly longer than $k$ steps,
or, more provocatively, because models <em>trainable by gradient descent</em> cannot
have long-term memory.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10369">our recent paper</a>, we study the gap
between recurrent and feed-forward models trained using gradient descent. We
show if the recurrent model is <em>stable</em> (meaning the gradients can not explode),
then the model can be well-approximated by a feed-forward network for the
purposes of both <em>inference and training.</em> In other words, we show feed-forward
and stable recurrent models trained by gradient descent are <em>equivalent</em> in the
sense of making identical predictions at test-time. Of course, not all models
trained in practice are stable. We also give empirical evidence the stability
condition can be imposed on certain recurrent models without loss in
performance.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Despite some initial attempts, there is still much to do to understand
why feed-forward models are competitive with recurrent ones and
shed light onto the trade-offs between sequence models. How much memory is
really needed to perform well on common sequence benchmarks? What are the
expressivity trade-offs between truncated RNNs (which can be considered
feed-forward) and the convolutional models that are in popular use? Why can
feed-forward networks perform as well as unstable RNNs in practice?</p>

<p>Answering these questions is a step towards building a theory that can both
explain the strengths and limitations of our current methods and give guidance
about how to choose between different classes of models in concrete settings.</p>
