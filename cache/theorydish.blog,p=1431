<div>We are pleased to announce the Call for Papers for the 2019 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAT*), to be held in Atlanta, Georgia in January/February 2019.</div>
<div/>
<div>FAT* is an interdisciplinary conference to connect social, technical and policy domains around broad questions of fairness, accountability and transparency of machine learning, information retrieval, and other computing systems. The conference this year features tracks on Theory And Security, Statistics, Machine Learning, and Data Mining. The inaugural conference at NYU in February 2018 had an acceptance rate of 25% and was sold-out, with 450 international attendees from across academia, industry and public policy.</div>
<div/>
<div>Papers (8-10 pages, due <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">August 23</span></span>) are double-blind peer reviewed and published in conference proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. Authors can also opt for non-archival submission, subject to the same review process but only appearing as an abstract in the proceedings. The theoretical computer science community has been involved in work on algorithmic fairness since its inception, and we hope that you’ll consider FAT* as a venue for your work.</div>
<div/>
<div>Please forward this call to other people or groups you think may be interested.</div>
