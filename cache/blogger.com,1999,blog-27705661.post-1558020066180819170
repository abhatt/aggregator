According to  Foer,  computer scientist started to use the term &quot;algorithm&quot; because of  &quot;status anxiety&quot;, as a form of name dropping by programmers to suggest  that they were also serious scientists. In my letter to Foer I give some  historic evidence that this framing is utterly incorrect, but I'd be  interested in the views of colleagues from the TCS community on this  matter. </i></blockquote><i>Please share your views on this matter as comments to this post. It is important to put the record straight and I am glad that Frits took the time to write a cogent letter to Mr. Foer. Thank you!</i><br/><br/><div id="wikitext">Dear Mr Foer,<br/><br/><div class="vspace">With much interest I have read your book “<a class="urllink" href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/533937/world-without-mind-by-franklin-foer/9781101981115/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">World without mind</a>”.   I agree with many of your conclusions!  But as a computer scientist  who has been working on algorithms for more than 30 years, I am also  deeply troubled by one paragraph in your book: </div><div class="vspace"><br/></div><div class="vspace"><i>“For the first decades of computing, the term  “algorithm” wasn’t much mentioned. But as computer science departments  began sprouting across campuses in the 60s, the term acquired a new  cachet. Its vogue was the product of status anxiety. Programmers,  especially in the academy, were anxious to show that they weren’t mere  technicians. They began to describe their work as algorithmic, in part  because it tied them to one of the greatest of all mathematicians – the  Persian polymath Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi, or as he was known in  Latin, Algoritmi. During the 12th century, translations of al-Khwarizmi  introduced Arabic numerals to the west; his treatises pioneered algebra  and trigonometry. By describing the algorithm as the fundamental element  of programming, the computer scientists were attaching themselves to a  grand history. It was a savvy piece of name-dropping: See, we’re not  arriviste, we’re working with abstractions and theories, just like the  mathematicians!”</i></div><div class="vspace"><i> </i></div><div class="vspace">Do you have historic sources for these strong statements? </div><div class="vspace"><br/></div><div class="vspace">Much of computer science is rooted in the work of  mathematicians and logicians such as Turing, Church and von Neumann.  These researchers used the word “algorithm” already before computers  were built, see for instance p349 of Alonzo Church’s 1936 paper “<a class="urllink" href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2371045" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">An unsolvable problem of elementary number theory</a>”.  Together with Turing’s 1936 paper “On computable numbers, with an  application to the entscheidungsproblem”, this paper forms the basis for  the so-called Church-Turing thesis, which in turn laid the foundation  of theoretical computer science. The computer science pioneers  definitely knew the term “algorithm”!! </div><div class="vspace"><br/></div><div class="vspace">The term “algorithm” was maybe not used so often by  computer scientists during the initial years (often they used terms such  as “effective procedure” or “computable function”), but that certainly  changed in 1958 with the influential work on ALGOL (short for  Algorithmic Language), a family of imperative computer programming  languages. The researchers who worked on Algol e.g. Bauer, Backus,  Dijkstra, Perlis, Naur, van Wijngaarden &amp; McCarthy were established  scientists who definitely did not suffer from “status anxiety”. Backus,  Dijkstra, Perlis, Naur and McCarthy later received the <a class="urllink" href="http://amturing.acm.org/byyear.cfm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Turing award</a>, the major prize for computer science research, for their groundbreaking research. </div><div class="vspace"><br/></div><div class="vspace">In order to appreciate the wonderful scientific work on algorithms, I can recommend you, for instance, to read the book <a class="urllink" href="http://www.springer.com/la/book/9783642272653" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Algorithmics – The spirit of computing</a> by David Harel. I hope that, after studying this book, you will be also  convinced that the fact that programmers used the term algorithm is not  a form of name dropping. The work on algorithms since the advent of  computers very much fits into the tradition of the work started by great  scientists like Euclides and al-Khwarizmi. </div><div class="vspace"><br/></div><div class="vspace">Scientific knowledge may always be used for both good  and bad things. Like you, I am very concerned about the use of  algorithms by Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon. But I disagree with  any suggestion that there is no science behind computer science  algorithms! </div><div class="vspace"><br/></div><div class="vspace">Looking forward to your reaction, with best regards, </div><div class="vspace"><br/></div><div class="vspace">Frits Vaandrager </div><div class="vspace">Professor of Computer Science at Radboud University </div><div class="vspace">Nijmegen, December 4, 2017 </div></div></div><div class="commentbar"><p/><span class="commentbutton" href="http://processalgebra.blogspot.com/feeds/1558020066180819170/comments/default"/><a href="http://processalgebra.blogspot.com/feeds/1558020066180819170/comments/default"><img class="commenticon" src="/images/feed-icon.png"/> Subscribe to comments</a><![CDATA[  | ]]><a href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=27705661&amp;postID=1558020066180819170"><img class="commenticon" src="/images/post-icon.png"/> Post a comment</a></div></content><updated planet:format="December 05, 2017 03:03 PM">2017-12-05T15:03:00Z</updated><published planet:format="December 05, 2017 03:03 PM">2017-12-05T15:03:00Z</published><author><name>Luca Aceto</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01092671728833265127</uri></author><source><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-27705661</id><author><name>Luca Aceto</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01092671728833265127</uri></author><link href="http://processalgebra.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#feed" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/27705661/posts/default" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://processalgebra.blogspot.com/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/" rel="hub" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/27705661/posts/default?start-index=26&amp;max-results=25" rel="next" type="application/atom+xml"/><subtitle>Papers I find interesting---mostly, but not solely, in Process Algebra---, and some fun stuff in Mathematics and Computer Science at large and on general issues related to research, teaching and academic life.</subtitle><title>Process Algebra Diary</title><updated planet:format="December 16, 2018 04:19 PM">2018-12-16T16:19:44Z</updated><planet:module>toc</planet:module><planet:format>atom10</planet:format><planet:http_etag>W/&quot;48f0fe25193a31ca0eb80ddb784c54ac8e96eb18f2285ecd00173dfc60536971&quot;</planet:http_etag><planet:http_last_modified>Sun, 16 Dec 2018 16:19:44 GMT</planet:http_last_modified><planet:bozo>false</planet:bozo><planet:items_per_page>40</planet:items_per_page><planet:css-id>luca-aceto</planet:css-id><planet:face>aceto.jpeg</planet:face><planet:name>Luca Aceto</planet:name><planet:http_status>200</planet:http_status></source></entry>
