What does this mean?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Michael’s looking for a post doc position.</strong> Michael has done some really nice work in the field of data stream algorithms including designing the <a href="http://people.cs.umass.edu/~mcgregor/papers/13-esa.pdf">first graph algorithms for the sliding window model</a>; analyzing <a href="http://people.cs.umass.edu/~mcc/pub/stochastic_streams.pdf">space-sample trade-offs in stochastic streams</a>; estimating <a href="http://people.cs.umass.edu/~mcgregor/papers/11-approx.pdf">stream periodicity via linear sketches</a>; and improving the best known results for approximate maximum weighted matching (to appear). Prior to this, he worked in descriptive complexity and built a system for <a href="http://people.cs.umass.edu/~mcc/pub/reductions.pdf">automatically finding reductions between problems</a>. Michael gives great lectures and also has a particular strength when it comes to helping and mentoring more junior students. Which brings me to… </li>
<li><strong>Dan’s applying to grad school.</strong> Dan worked with Michael on the above graph algorithms and separately has a really neat result on <a href="http://people.cs.umass.edu/~mcgregor/papers/13-approx1.pdf">sketching the earth-mover distance on graph metrics</a>. Of particular note is that he has just been declared:
<p/>
<p align="center"><a href="http://cra.org/awards/undergrad-current/">Winner of the 2014 CRA Outstanding Undergraduate Research Awards!</a></p>
<p> This award “recognizes undergraduate students in North American colleges and universities who show outstanding research potential in an area of computing research.” Except, in Dan’s case, I’d skip the word “potential”.
 </p></li>
<li><strong> I’m looking for new students!</strong> If you’re applying to grad school and are interested in data stream algorithms, or algorithms in general, please consider submitting your application to UMass Amherst. Details are <a href="http://www.cs.umass.edu/admissions/prospective-graduates">here</a> and our deadline is December 15th. For more details about my research interests see my <a href="http://people.cs.umass.edu/~mcgregor/">website</a>. And check-out the <a href="http://people.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/theoryOfComputation.html">UMass Theory Group</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p>Email me if you’d like to follow-up on any of the above points.</p></div></content><updated planet:format="December 13, 2013 09:53 PM">2013-12-13T21:53:47Z</updated><published planet:format="December 13, 2013 09:53 PM">2013-12-13T21:53:47Z</published><category term="Uncategorized"/><author><name>Andrew</name></author><source><id>https://polylogblog.wordpress.com</id><logo>https://secure.gravatar.com/blavatar/de3938169031cf15bbcc541db1d9ba57?s=96&amp;d=https%3A%2F%2Fs0.wp.com%2Fi%2Fbuttonw-com.png</logo><link href="https://polylogblog.wordpress.com/feed/" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="https://polylogblog.wordpress.com" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="https://polylogblog.wordpress.com/osd.xml" rel="search" type="application/opensearchdescription+xml"/><link href="https://polylogblog.wordpress.com/?pushpress=hub" rel="hub" type="text/html"/><title>the polylogblog</title><updated planet:format="December 17, 2018 05:29 AM">2018-12-17T05:29:38Z</updated><planet:module>toc</planet:module><planet:format>atom10</planet:format><planet:http_last_modified>Mon, 19 Nov 2018 02:05:44 GMT</planet:http_last_modified><planet:bozo>false</planet:bozo><planet:items_per_page>40</planet:items_per_page><planet:css-id>andrew-mcgregor</planet:css-id><planet:face>mcgregor.jpg</planet:face><planet:name>Andrew McGregor</planet:name><planet:http_location>https://polylogblog.wordpress.com/feed/</planet:http_location><planet:http_status>301</planet:http_status></source></entry>
