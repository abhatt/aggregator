The Ornstein–Uhlenbeck semigroup dates back to the work of Uhlenbeck and Ornstein <b>[UO30]</b> whose motivation was to refine Einstein’s theory of Brownian motion <b>[Ein05]</b> to take into account the inertia of the particle. The relationship between the action of $\mathrm{U}_\rho$ on functions and on Hermite expansions (i.e., Proposition <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/?p=1694#prophermite-correlation" target="_blank">31</a>) dates back even further, to Mehler <b>[Meh66]</b>. Hermite polynomials were first defined by Laplace <b>[Lap11]</b>, and then studied by Chebyshev <b>[Che60]</b> and Hermite <b>[Her64]</b>. See Lebedev <b>[Leb72]</b> (Chapter 4.15) for a proof of the pointwise convergence of a piecewise-$\mathcal{C}^1$ function’s Hermite expansion. </p>

As mentioned in the <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/?p=1511" target="_blank">notes on Chapter 9</a>, the Gaussian Hypercontractivity Theorem is originally due to Nelson <b>[Nel66]</b> and now has many known proofs. The idea behind the proof we presented — first proving the Boolean hypercontractivity result and then deducing the Gaussian case by the Central Limit Theorem — is due to Gross <b>[Gro75]</b> (see also Trotter <b>[Tro58]</b>). Gross actually used the idea to prove his Gaussian Log-Sobolev Inequality, and thereby deduced the Gaussian Hypercontractivity Theorem. Direct proofs of the Gaussian Hypercontractivity Theorem have been given by Neveu <b>[Nev76]</b> (using stochastic calculus), Brascamp and Lieb <b>[BL76a]</b> (using rearrangement <b>[BL76a]</b>), and Ledoux <b>[Led13]</b> (using a variation on Exercises <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/?p=2253#exmossel-neeman1" target="_blank">26</a>–<a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/?p=2276#exmossel-neeman4" target="_blank">29</a>); direct proofs of the Gaussian Log-Sobolev Inequality have been given by Adams and Clarke <b>[AC79]</b>, by Bakry and Emery <b>[BE85a]</b>, and by Ledoux <b>[Led92]</b>, the latter two using semigroup techniques. Bakry’s survey <b>[Bak94]</b> on these topics is also recommended.</p>
<p>
 The Gaussian Isoperimetric Inequality was first proved independently by Borell <b>[Bor75]</b> and by Sudakov and Tsirel’son <b>[ST78]</b>. Both works derived the result by taking the isoperimetric inequality on the sphere (due to Lévy <b>[Lev22]</b> and Schmidt <b>[Sch48]</b>, see also Figiel, Lindenstrauss, and Milman <b>[FLM77]</b>) and then taking “Poincaré’s limit” — i.e., viewing Gaussian space as a projection of the sphere of radius $\sqrt{n}$ in $n$ dimensions, with $n \to \infty$ (see Lévy <b>[Lev22]</b>, McKean <b>[McK73]</b>, and Diaconis and Freedman <b>[DF87]</b>). Ehrhard <b>[Ehr83]</b> gave a different proof using a symmetrization argument intrinsic to Gaussian space. This may be compared to the alternate proof of the spherical isoperimetric inequality <b>[Ben84]</b> based on the “two-point symmetrization” of Baernstein and Taylor <b>[BT76]</b> (analogous to Riesz rearrangement in Euclidean space and to the polarization operation from Exercise <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/?p=494#expolarization" target="_blank">2.45</a>).</p>
<p>
 To carefully define Gaussian surface area for a broad class of sets requires venturing into the study of geometric measure theory and functions of bounded variation. For a clear and comprehensive development in the Euclidean setting (including the remark in Exercise <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/?p=2253#exessential-boundary" target="_blank">15</a>), see the book by Ambrosio, Fusco, and Pallara <b>[AFP00]</b>. There’s not much difference between the Euclidean and finite-dimensional Gaussian settings; research on Gaussian perimeter tends to focus on the trickier infinite-dimensional case. For a thorough development of surface area in this latter setting (which of course includes finite-dimensional Gaussian space as a special case) see the work of Ambrosio, Miranda, Maniglia, and Pallara <b>[AMMP10]</b>; in particular, Theorem 4.1 in that work gives several additional equivalent definitions for $\text{surf}_\gamma$ besides those in Definition <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/?p=2199#defunusual-gsa-def" target="_blank">48</a>. Regarding the fact that $\mathbf{RS}_A’(0^+)$ is an equivalent definition, the Euclidean analogue of this statement was proven in Miranda et al. <b>[MPPP07]</b> and the statement itself follows similarly <b>[Mir13]</b> using Ambrosio et al. <b>[AFR13]</b>. (Our heuristic justification of <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/?p=2199" target="_blank">11.4.(2)</a> is similar to the one given by Kane <b>[Kan11a]</b>.) Additional related results can be found in Hino <b>[Hin10]</b> (which includes the remark about convex sets at the end of Definition <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/?p=2199#defunusual-gsa-def" target="_blank">48</a>), Ambrosio and Figalli <b>[AF11]</b>, Miranda et al. <b>[MNP12]</b>, and Ambrosio et al. <b>[AFR13]</b>.</p>
<p>
The inequality of Theorem <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/?p=2199#thmgsa-concavity" target="_blank">51</a> is explicit in Ledoux <b>[Led94]</b> (see also the excellent survey <b>[Led96]</b>); he used it to deduce the Gaussian Isoperimetric Inequality. He also noted that it’s essentially deducible from an earlier inequality of Pisier and Maurey <b>[Pis86]</b> (Theorem 2.2). Theorem <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/?p=1714#thmrs-subadditive" target="_blank">43</a>, which expresses the subadditivity of rotation sensitivity, can be viewed as a discretization of the Pisier–Maurey inequality. This theorem appeared in work of Kindler and O’Donnell <b>[KO12]</b>, which also made the observations about the volume-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ case of Borell’s Isoperimetric Theorem at the end of Section <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/?p=1714" target="_blank">3</a> and in Remark <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/?p=2245#remeasy-almost-gw" target="_blank">75</a>.</p>
<p>
 Bobkov’s Inequality <b>[Bob97]</b> in the special case of Gaussian space had already been implicitly established by Ehrhard <b>[Ehr84]</b>; the striking novelty of Bobkov’s work (partially inspired by Talagrand <b>[Tal93]</b>) was his reduction to the two-point Boolean inequality. The proof of this inequality which we presented is, as mentioned a discretization of the stochastic calculus proof of Barthe and Maurey <b>[BM00a]</b>. (In turn, they were extending the stochastic calculus proof of Bobkov’s Inequality in the Gaussian setting due to Capitaine, Hsu, and Ledoux <b>[CHL97]</b>.) The idea that it’s enough to show that Claim <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/?p=2199#claimbobkov" target="_blank">54</a> is “nearly true” by computing two derivatives — as opposed to showing it’s exactly true by computing four derivatives — was communicated to the author by Yuval Peres. Following Bobkov’s paper, Bakry and Ledoux <b>[BL96b]</b> established Theorem <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/?p=2199#thmmy-bobkov" target="_blank">55</a> in very general infinite-dimensional settings including Gaussian space; Ledoux <b>[Led98]</b> further pointed out that the Gaussian version of Bobkov’s Inequality has a very short and direct semigroup-based proof. See also Bobkov and Götze <b>[BG99]</b> and Tillich and Zémor <b>[TZ00]</b> for results similar to Bobkov’s Inequality in other discrete settings. Borell’s Isoperimetric Theorem is from Borell <b>[Bor85]</b>. Borell’s proof used “Ehrhard symmetrization” and actually gave much stronger results — e.g., that if $f, g \in L^2({\mathbb R}^n, \gamma)$ are nonnegative and $q \geq 1$, then $\langle (\mathrm{U}_\rho f)^q, g\rangle$ can only increase under simultaneous Ehrhard symmetrization of $f$ and $g$. There are at least four other known proofs of the basic Borell Isoperimetric Theorem. Beckner <b>[Bec92]</b> observed that the analogous isoperimetric theorem on the sphere follows from two-point symmetrization; this yields the Gaussian result via Poincaré’s limit (for details, see Carlen and Loss <b>[CL90]</b>). (This proof is perhaps the conceptually simplest one, though carrying out all the technical details is a chore.) Mossel and Neeman <b>[MN12]</b> gave the proof based on semigroup methods outlined in Exercises <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/?p=2253#exmossel-neeman1" target="_blank">26</a>–<a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/?p=2276#exmossel-neeman4" target="_blank">29</a>, and later together with De <b>[DMN12]</b> gave a “Bobkov-style” Boolean proof (see Exercise <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/?p=2276#exDMN" target="_blank">30</a>). Finally, Eldan <b>[Eld13]</b> gave a proof using stochastic calculus.</p>
<p>
 As mentioned in Section <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/?p=2213" target="_blank">5</a> there are several known ways to prove the Berry–Esseen Theorem. Aside from the original method (characteristic functions), there is also Stein’s Method <b>[Ste72,Ste86a]</b>; see also, e.g., <b>[Bol84,BH84,CGS11]</b>. The Replacement Method approach we presented originates in the work of Lindeberg <b>[Lin22]</b>. The mollification techniques used (e.g., those in Exercise <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/?p=2276#exmollifier" target="_blank">40</a>) are standard. The Invariance Principle as presented in Section <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/?p=2230" target="_blank">6</a> is from Mossel, O’Donnell, and Oleszkiewicz <b>[MOO10]</b>. Further extensions (e.g., Exercise <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/?p=2276#exmultifun-invariance" target="_blank">48</a>) appear in the work of Mossel <b>[Mos10]</b>. In fact the Invariance Principle dates back to the 1971 work of Rotar’ <b>[Rot73,Rot74]</b>; therein he essentially proved the Invariance Principle for degree-$2$ multilinear polynomials (even employing the term “influence” as we do for the quantity in Definition <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/?p=2230#defmultilinear-poly" target="_blank">63</a>). Earlier work on extending the Central Limit Theorem to higher-degree polynomials had focused on obtaining sufficient conditions for polynomials (especially quadratics) to have a Gaussian limit distribution; this is the subject of <em>U-statistics</em>. Rotar’ emphasized the idea of invariance and of allowing any (quadratic) polynomial with low influences. Rotar’ also credited Girko <b>[Gir73]</b> with related results in the case of positive definite quadratic forms. In 1975, Rotar’ <b>[Rot75]</b> generalized his results to handle multilinear polynomials of any constant degree, and also random vectors (as in Exercise <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/?p=2276#exmultifun-invariance" target="_blank">48</a>). (Rotar’ also gave further refinements in 1979 <b>[Rot79]</b>.)</p>
<p>
The difference between the results of Rotar’ <b>[Rot75]</b> and Mossel et al. <b>[MOO10]</b> comes in the treatment of the error bounds. It’s somewhat difficult to extract simple-to-state error bounds from Rotar’ <b>[Rot75]</b>, as the error there is presented as a sum over $i \in [n]$ of expressions $\mathop{\bf E}[F({\boldsymbol{x}}) \boldsymbol{1}_{|F({\boldsymbol{x}})| &gt; u_i}]$, where $u_i$ involves $\mathbf{Inf}_i[F]$. (Partly this is so as to generalize the statement of the Lindeberg CLT.) Nevertheless, the work of Rotar’ implies a Lévy distance bound as in Corollary <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/?p=2230#corbasic-inv-levy" target="_blank">69</a>, with some inexplicit function $o_\epsilon(1)$ in place of $(1/\rho)^{O(k)} \epsilon^{1/8}$. By contrast, the work of Mossel et al. <b>[MOO10]</b> shows that a straightforward combination of the Replacement Method and hypercontractivity yields good, explicit error bounds. Regarding the Carbery–Wright Theorem <b>[CW01]</b>, an alternative exposition appears in Nazarov, Sodin, and Vol’berg <b>[NSV02]</b>.</p>
<p>
 Regarding the Majority Is Stablest Theorem (conjectured in Khot, Kindler, Mossel, and O’Donnell <b>[KKMO04]</b> and proved originally in Mossel, O’Donnell, and Oleszkiewicz <b>[MOO05a]</b>), it can be added that additional motivation for the conjecture came from Kalai <b>[Kal02]</b>. The fact that <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/?p=2245" target="_blank">(SDP)</a> is an efficiently computable relaxation for the Max-Cut problem dates back to the 1990 work of Delorme and Poljak <b>[DP93]</b>; however, they were unable to give an analysis relating its value to the optimum cut value. In fact, they conjectured that the case of the $5$-cycle from Example <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/?p=2245#eg5-cycle" target="_blank">72</a> had the worst ratio of $\mathrm{Opt}(G)$ to $\mathrm{SDPOpt}(G)$. Goemans and Williamson <b>[GW94]</b> were the first to give a sharp analysis of the SDP (Theorem <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/?p=2245#thmgw-behavior" target="_blank">71</a>), at least for $\theta \geq \theta^*$. Feige and Schechtman <b>[FS02]</b> showed an optimal integrality gap for the SDP for all values $\theta \geq \theta^*$ (in particular, showing an integrality gap ratio of $c_{\text{GW}}$); interestingly, their construction essentially involved proving Borell’s Isoperimetric Inequality (though they did it on the sphere rather than in Gaussian space). Both before and after the Khot et al. <b>[KKMO04]</b> UG-hardness result for Max-Cut there was a long line of work <b>[Kar99,Zwi99,AS00,ASZ02,CW04,KV05,FL06,KO06]</b> devoted to improving the known approximation algorithms and UG-hardness results, in particular for $\theta &lt; \theta^*$. This culminated in the results from O’Donnell and Wu <b>[OW08]</b> (mentioned in Remark <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/?p=2245#remow08" target="_blank">74</a>), which showed explicit matching $(\alpha,\beta)$-approximation algorithms, integrality gaps, and UG-hardness results for all $\frac12 &lt; \beta &lt; 1$. The fact that the best integrality gaps matched the best UG-hardness results proved not to be a coincidence; in contemporaneous work, Raghavendra <b>[Rag08]</b> showed that for <em>any</em> CSP, <em>any</em> SDP integrality gap could be turned into a matching Dictator-vs.-No-Notables test. This implies the existence of matching efficient $(\alpha,\beta)$-approximation algorithms and UG-hardness results for every CSP and every $\beta$. See Raghavendra’s thesis <b>[Rag09]</b> for full details of his earlier publication <b>[Rag08]</b> (including some Invariance Principle extensions building further on Mossel <b>[Mos10]</b>); see also Austrin’s work <b>[Aus07,Aus07a]</b> for precursors to the Raghavendra theory.</p>

Exercise <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/?p=2276#exTal1000" target="_blank">31</a> concerns a problem introduced by Talagrand <b>[Tal89]</b>. Talagrand offers a $1000 prize <b>[Tal06a]</b> for a solution to the following Boolean version of the problem: Show that for any fixed $0 &lt; \rho &lt; 1$ and for $f : \{-1,1\}^n \to {\mathbb R}^{\geq 0}$ with $\mathop{\bf E}[f] = 1$ it holds that $\mathop{\bf Pr}[\mathrm{T}_\rho f &gt; t] = o(1/t)$ as $t \to \infty$. (The rate of decay may depend on $\rho$ but not, of course, on $n$; in fact, a bound of the form $O(\frac{1}{t \sqrt{\log t}})$ is expected.) The result outlined in Exercise <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/?p=2276#exTal1000" target="_blank">31</a> (obtained together with James Lee) is for the very special case of $1$-dimensional Gaussian space; Ball, Barthe, Bednorz, Oleszkiewicz, and Wolff <b>[BBB+13]</b> obtained the same result and also showed a bound of $O(\frac{\log \log t}{t \sqrt{\log t}})$ for $d$-dimensional Gaussian space (with the constant in the $O(\cdot)$ depending on $d$).</p>

The Multifunction Invariance Principle (Exercise <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/?p=2276#exmultifun-invariance" target="_blank">48</a> and its special case Exercise <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/?p=2276#exmultivar-be" target="_blank">46</a>) are from Mossel <b>[Mos10]</b>; the version for general product spaces (Exercise <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/?p=2276#exgeneral-invariance" target="_blank">49</a>) is from Mossel, O’Donnell, and Oleszkiewicz <b>[MOO10]</b>.</p></div></content><updated planet:format="May 28, 2014 02:28 PM">2014-05-28T14:28:58Z</updated><published planet:format="May 28, 2014 02:28 PM">2014-05-28T14:28:58Z</published><category term="Book"/><category term="Chapter 11: Gaussian space and Invariance Principles"/><category term="Chapter notes"/><category term="Berry--Esseen Theorem"/><category term="Bobkov's Inequality"/><category term="Borell's Isoperimetric Theorem"/><category term="Carbery-Wright Theorem"/><category term="Gaussian Hypercontractivity Theorem"/><category term="Gaussian Isoperimetric Inequality"/><category term="Gaussian noise operator"/><category term="Gaussian space"/><category term="Gaussian surface area"/><category term="Hermite polynomials"/><category term="Invariance Principle"/><category term="Log-Sobolev Inequality"/><category term="rotation sensitivity"/><author><name>Ryan O'Donnell</name></author><source><id>http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod</id><link href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/index.php?feed=rss2" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><subtitle>My tagline</subtitle><title>Analysis of Boolean Functions</title><updated planet:format="December 17, 2018 05:29 AM">2018-12-17T05:29:42Z</updated><planet:module>toc</planet:module><planet:format>atom10</planet:format><planet:http_etag>&quot;d9ceca021f62d386fadb15cdc8746a4b-gzip&quot;</planet:http_etag><planet:http_last_modified>Mon, 24 Jul 2017 02:59:51 GMT</planet:http_last_modified><planet:bozo>false</planet:bozo><planet:items_per_page>40</planet:items_per_page><planet:css-id>ryan-o-donnell</planet:css-id><planet:face>odonnell.jpeg</planet:face><planet:name>Ryan O'Donnell</planet:name><planet:http_status>200</planet:http_status></source></entry>
