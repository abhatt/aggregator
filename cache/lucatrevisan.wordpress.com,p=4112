Under current tax law, students pay income tax “only” on their stipend. A provision in the tax bill currently under consideration would count the waived tuition as income, on which the student would have to pay taxes as well.</p>
<p>A calculation by a Berkeley physics graduate student (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e3oIk8AO9F_UL98z5cieKha1V5e9azzB/view">source</a>) finds that a student who work as TA for both semesters and the summer, is payed at “step 1” of the UC Berkeley salary scale,  and is a California resident, currently pays ​$2,229 in federal income tax, which would become ​$3,641​ under the proposed tax plan, a 61% increase. The situation for EECS students is a bit different: they are paid at a higher scale, which puts them in a higher bracket, and they are often on a F1 visa, which means that they pay the much-higher non-resident tuition, so they would be a lot worse off (on the other hand, they usually TA at most one semester per year). The same calculation for MIT students shows a 240% tax increase. A different calculation (sorry, no link available) shows a 144% increase for a Berkeley EECS student on a F! visa.</p>
<p>This is one of the tax increases that go to fund the abolition of the estate tax for estates worth more than $10.9 million, a reduction in corporate tax rates, a reduction in high-income tax rates, and other benefits for multi-millionaires. </p>
<p>There is also a <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/7/16612288/gop-tax-bill-graduate-students">vox explainer</a>, and articles in <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/11/07/grad-students-and-policy-experts-say-taxing-graduate-students-tuition-waivers-would">inside higher ed</a> and the <a href="http://www.chronicle.com/article/How-the-GOP-Tax-Plan-Could/241702">chronicle of higher education</a> with more information.</p>
<p>If you are a US Citizen, and if you think that graduate students should not pay for the estate tax of eight-figure estates, you should let you representative know. Usually calling, and asking to speak with the staffer responsible for tax policy, is much better than emailing or sending a physical mail. You can find the phone numbers of your representatives <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you have any pull in ACM, this is the kind of matter on which they might want to make a factual statement about the consequences for US computer science education, as they did at the time of the travel ban. </p></div></content><updated planet:format="November 08, 2017 06:15 AM">2017-11-08T06:15:40Z</updated><published planet:format="November 08, 2017 06:15 AM">2017-11-08T06:15:40Z</published><category term="Berkeley"/><category term="politics"/><category term="taxes"/><author><name>luca</name></author><source><id>https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com</id><logo>https://s0.wp.com/i/buttonw-com.png</logo><link href="https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/feed/" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/osd.xml" rel="search" type="application/opensearchdescription+xml"/><link href="https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/?pushpress=hub" rel="hub" type="text/html"/><subtitle>&quot;Marge, I agree with you - in theory.
