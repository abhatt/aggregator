<p dir="ltr">EC’19 has four technical tracks, detailed below.  Each paper submission must designate one track, and will be reviewed by program committee members assigned to that track.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>AI</strong>. Areas of interest include: social choice; fair division; prediction markets; preference elicitation; equilibrium computation and computational game theory; automated agents; theory of machine learning; behavioral game theory and bounded rationality; privacy, fairness, and ethics; data markets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Applied modeling</strong>. Papers submitted to this track should emphasize mathematical modeling of real-world systems; areas of interest include: ridesharing; kidney exchanges; school choice; labor markets; spectrum auctions; crowdsourcing; online platforms; the sharing economy; online advertising; economics of the cloud; cryptocurrency; peer grading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Empirics</strong>. Papers submitted to the empirics track should primarily contain results derived by empirical methods; areas of interest include: computational social science; causal inference; experiments; structural estimation; data mining; applied machine learning; empirical analysis of real-world systems (e.g., online and offline platforms and markets); empirical behavioral economics; social networks (empirical analysis).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Theory</strong>. Papers submitted to the theory track should provide a strong methodological contribution; areas of interest include: market design; auctions; pricing; resource allocation; matching; price of anarchy; social learning; social networks (theory); learning in games; fair division; complexity of equilibria.  Select accepted papers in this track will appear in joint sessions of EC’19 and the 51st Annual ACM Symposium on the Theory of Computing (STOC’19).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition, EC’19 is piloting a new program to offer authors of accepted papers the option to have their reviews and paper forwarded to a journal.  Our partner journals are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/games-and-economic-behavior">Games and Economic Behavior</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/journal/opre">Operations Research</a>, Revenue Management and Market Analytics area</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/11129">Quantitative Marketing and Economics</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://teac.acm.org/">ACM Transactions on Economics and Computation</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Full details on the process for forwarding to journal are available at the conference website above.</p>
