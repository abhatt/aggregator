	Pasin Manurangsi</title><summary>Given a set of $n$ points in $\mathbb R^d$, the (monochromatic) Closest Pair problem asks to find a pair of distinct points in the set that are closest in the $\ell_p$-metric. Closest Pair is a fundamental problem in Computational Geometry and understanding its fine-grained complexity in the Euclidean metric when $d=\omega(\log n)$ was raised as an open question in recent works (Abboud-Rubinstein-Williams [FOCS'17], Williams [SODA'18], David-Karthik-Laekhanukit [SoCG'18]).

In this paper, we show that for every $p\in\mathbb R_{\ge 1}\cup\{0\}$, under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH), for every  $\varepsilon&gt;0$, the following holds:

$\bullet$  No algorithm running in time $O(n^{2-\varepsilon})$ can solve the Closest Pair problem in $d=(\log n)^{\Omega_{\varepsilon}(1)}$ dimensions in the $\ell_p$-metric.

$\bullet$  There exists $\delta = \delta(\varepsilon)&gt;0$ and $c = c(\varepsilon)\ge 1$ such that no algorithm running in time $O(n^{1.5-\varepsilon})$ can approximate Closest Pair problem to a factor of $(1+\delta)$ in $d\ge c\log n$ dimensions in the $\ell_p$-metric.


In particular, our first result is shown by establishing the computational equivalence of the bichromatic Closest Pair problem and the (monochromatic) Closest Pair problem (up to $n^{\varepsilon}$ factor in the running time) for $d=(\log n)^{\Omega_\varepsilon(1)}$ dimensions.

Additionally, under SETH, we rule out nearly-polynomial  factor approximation algorithms  running in subquadratic time for the (monochromatic) Maximum Inner Product problem where we are given a set of $n$ points in $n^{o(1)}$-dimensional Euclidean space and are required to find a pair of distinct points in the set that maximize the inner product. 


At the heart of all our proofs is the construction of a dense bipartite graph with low contact dimension, i.e., we construct a balanced bipartite graph on $n$ vertices with $n^{2-\varepsilon}$ edges whose vertices can be realized as points in a $(\log n)^{\Omega_\varepsilon(1)}$-dimensional Euclidean space  such that every pair of vertices which have an edge in the graph are at distance exactly 1 and every other pair of vertices are at distance greater than 1. This graph construction is inspired by the construction of locally dense codes introduced by Dumer-Miccancio-Sudan [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory'03].<div class="commentbar"><p/></div></summary><updated planet:format="December 10, 2018 12:31 AM">2018-12-10T00:31:47Z</updated><published planet:format="December 10, 2018 12:31 AM">2018-12-10T00:31:47Z</published><source><id>https://example.com/</id><author><name>ECCC papers</name></author><link href="https://example.com/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="https://example.com/feeds/reports/" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><subtitle>Latest Reports published at https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il</subtitle><title>ECCC - Reports</title><updated planet:format="December 17, 2018 05:29 AM">2018-12-17T05:29:16Z</updated><planet:bozo>false</planet:bozo><planet:module>toc</planet:module><planet:format>atom10</planet:format><planet:items_per_page>40</planet:items_per_page><planet:face>eccc.png</planet:face><planet:name>ECCC papers</planet:name><planet:css-id>eccc-papers</planet:css-id><planet:http_status>301</planet:http_status><planet:http_location>https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il//feeds/reports/</planet:http_location></source></entry>
