This fall Simons has a program in <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/complexity2018">Lower Bounds in Computational Complexity</a>. Scroll down that page and you'll see the rather strong collection of participants that are spending much of the fall at the Institute.<br/>
<br/>
I purposely chose a week without a workshop--I'd rather talk to people than sit in talks. My former PhD student Rahul Santhanam is hosting me and we are having some fun discussions about the minimum circuit-size problems, pseudorandom generators and white vs black box algorithms. I've grown a little rusty in complexity during my years as department chair and have to work to keep up with Rahul. The student has become the master.<br/>
<br/>
Even a quiet week at Simons is not that quiet. Every night seems to have a theme: trivia, board games, pub night, music night. I participated in a discussion with the &quot;journalist in residence&quot; on how to make lower bounds interesting to the general public. As part of a Turing awardee lecture series, Andy Yao gave a talk on <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/events/game-theory-in-auction-and-blockchain">Game Theory in Auction and Blockchain</a> which included some reminiscing of Yao's golden time in Berkeley back in the early 80's when he helped lay the mathematical foundations of modern cryptography.<br/>
<br/>
Simons started as a <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2010/08/new-institute-for-theory-of-computing.html">competition</a> and, while I was on team Chicago, I have to admit Berkeley has done a wonderful job with the institute. We've just seen the results from another competition, with Amazon splitting their &quot;second headquarters&quot; between Northern Virginia and Queens, missing an awesome opportunity in Atlanta (not that I'm biased). Not surprised about the DC area, but pretty surprised about separating the HQ into two locations, neither planned to reach the level of activity of HQ1 in Seattle. Amazon stated that they didn't think they could find the tech talent to fill 50,000 positions in a single city. So much for &quot;build it and they will come&quot;.</div><div class="commentbar"><p/></div></summary><updated planet:format="November 15, 2018 04:59 PM">2018-11-15T16:59:00Z</updated><published planet:format="November 15, 2018 04:59 PM">2018-11-15T16:59:00Z</published><author><name>Lance Fortnow</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><source><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3722233</id><category term="typecast"/><category term="focs metacomments"/><author><name>Lance Fortnow</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><link href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><subtitle>Computational Complexity and other fun stuff in math and computer science from Lance Fortnow and Bill Gasarch</subtitle><title>Computational Complexity</title><updated planet:format="December 17, 2018 01:56 AM">2018-12-17T01:56:55Z</updated><planet:module>toc</planet:module><planet:format>atom10</planet:format><planet:http_etag>W/&quot;3c48828af0b9b548c409eba7b894fc342a0679ccd23a3f1db96c1212435d64c9&quot;</planet:http_etag><planet:http_last_modified>Sun, 16 Dec 2018 21:24:54 GMT</planet:http_last_modified><planet:bozo>false</planet:bozo><planet:items_per_page>40</planet:items_per_page><planet:css-id>computational-complexity</planet:css-id><planet:face>gasarch.png</planet:face><planet:name>Computational Complexity</planet:name><planet:http_status>200</planet:http_status></source></entry>
