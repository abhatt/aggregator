<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2016 Massachusetts voters voted to legalize Marijuana. Except they didn’t know what they were voting for! In Colorado and Washington, the question of legalization and commercialization were completely separate. The marijuana industry apparently learned from that and rigged the Massachusetts ballot question so that a voter legalizing marijuana would also be mandating communities to open marijuana stores. For Newton, MA, this means <strong>at least</strong> 8 stores. When voters were recently polled, it became clear that the vast majority did not know that this was at stake, and that the majority of them in fact does not want to open marijuana stores in their communities. For example, when I voted I didn’t know that this was at stake. Read the <a href="http://www.sec.state.ma.us/ele/elepdf/IFV_2016.pdf">official Massachusetts document to inform voters,</a> see especially the summary on pages 12-13. There is no hint that a community would be mandated by state law to open marijuana stores unless it goes through an additional legislative crusade. Instead it says that communities can choose. I think I even read the summary back then.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now to avoid opening stores in Newton, MA, we need a new ballot question. The City Council could have put this question on the ballot easily, but a few days ago decided that it won’t by a vote of 13 to 8. You can find the list of names of councilors and how they voted <a href="http://optoutnewton.org/index.php/2018/07/10/july-9th-meeting-outcome/">here</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Note that the council was not deciding whether or not to open stores, it was just deciding whether or not we should have a question about this on the ballot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead now we are stuck doing things the hard way. To put this question on the ballot, we need to collect 6000 signatures, or 9000 if the city is completely uncooperative, a possibility which now unfortunately cannot be dismissed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However we must do it, for the alternative is too awful. Most of the surrounding towns (Wellesley, Weston, Needham, Dedham, etc.) have already opted out. So if Newton opens stores, it basically becomes the hub for west suburban marijuana users, at least some of whom would drive under the influence of marijuana (conveniently undetectable). Proposed store locations include sites on the way to elementary schools, and there is an <a href="http://optoutnewton.org/index.php/2018/07/13/a-note-from-the-growth-companies-president">amusing proposal</a> to open a marijuana store in a prime Newton Center Location, after Peet’s Coffee moves out (they lost the bid for renewal of the lease). The owners of the space admit that people have asked them for a small grocery store instead, but they think that a marijuana store would bring more traffic and business to Newton Center. I told them to open a gym instead. That too would bring traffic and business, but in addition it would have other benefits that cannabis does not have.</p></div></content><updated planet:format="July 16, 2018 01:43 AM">2018-07-16T01:43:25Z</updated><published planet:format="July 16, 2018 01:43 AM">2018-07-16T01:43:25Z</published><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="health"/><category term="marijuana"/><category term="Utopia"/><author><name>Emanuele</name></author><source><id>https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com</id><logo>https://s0.wp.com/i/buttonw-com.png</logo><link href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/feed/" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/osd.xml" rel="search" type="application/opensearchdescription+xml"/><link href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/?pushpress=hub" rel="hub" type="text/html"/><subtitle>By Emanuele Viola</subtitle><title>Thoughts</title><updated planet:format="December 17, 2018 05:30 AM">2018-12-17T05:30:13Z</updated><planet:module>toc</planet:module><planet:format>atom10</planet:format><planet:http_last_modified>Thu, 06 Dec 2018 20:12:45 GMT</planet:http_last_modified><planet:bozo>false</planet:bozo><planet:items_per_page>40</planet:items_per_page><planet:css-id>emanuele-viola</planet:css-id><planet:face>viola.jpeg</planet:face><planet:name>Emanuele Viola</planet:name><planet:http_location>https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/feed/</planet:http_location><planet:http_status>301</planet:http_status></source></entry>
