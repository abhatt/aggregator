<br/>
Ehsan said that &quot;if email had sender authentication built in from the beginning then we wouldn't have the phishing problems we have today&quot;. Leaving aside whether this statement is fully true, why didn't we put sender authentication and encryption in the first email systems?<br/>
<br/>
Email goes back to the 60's but I did get involved on the early side when I <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2011/06/creating-email-system-at-cornell.html">wrote</a> an email system for Cornell in the early 80's. So let me take a crack at answering that question.<br/>
<br/>
Of course there are the technical reasons. RSA was invented just a few years earlier and there were no production systems and the digital signatures needed for authentication were just a theory back then. The amount of overhead needed for encryption in time and bandwidth would have stopped email in its tracks back then.<br/>
<br/>
But it's not like we said we wish we could have added encryption to email if we had the resources. BITNET which Cornell used and the ARPANET gateway only connected with other universities, government agencies and maybe some industrial research labs. We generally trusted each other and didn't expect anyone to fake email for the purpose of getting passwords. It's not like these emails could have links to fake login pages. We had no web back then.<br/>
<br/>
But we did all receive an email from a law firm offering green card help. My first spam message. We had a mild panic but little did we guess that spam would nearly take down email at the turn of the century. Nor would we have guessed the solution would come from machine learning which kills nearly all spam and much of the phishing emails today.<br/>
<br/>
I don't disagree with the report that we shouldn't think about the negative broader impacts, but the true impacts negative and positive are nearly impossible to predict. Computer Science works best when we experiment with ideas, get things working and fix problems as they arise. We can't let the fear of the future prevent us from getting there.</div><div class="commentbar"><p/></div></summary><updated planet:format="September 20, 2018 12:19 PM">2018-09-20T12:19:00Z</updated><published planet:format="September 20, 2018 12:19 PM">2018-09-20T12:19:00Z</published><author><name>Lance Fortnow</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><source><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3722233</id><category term="typecast"/><category term="focs metacomments"/><author><name>Lance Fortnow</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><link href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><subtitle>Computational Complexity and other fun stuff in math and computer science from Lance Fortnow and Bill Gasarch</subtitle><title>Computational Complexity</title><updated planet:format="December 16, 2018 04:30 PM">2018-12-16T16:30:55Z</updated><planet:module>toc</planet:module><planet:format>atom10</planet:format><planet:http_etag>W/&quot;1162ac7eaeeb73488e60859f750d00c44f2c15f72edc4dd39920b620c07641e6&quot;</planet:http_etag><planet:http_last_modified>Sun, 16 Dec 2018 10:16:47 GMT</planet:http_last_modified><planet:bozo>false</planet:bozo><planet:items_per_page>40</planet:items_per_page><planet:css-id>computational-complexity</planet:css-id><planet:face>gasarch.png</planet:face><planet:name>Computational Complexity</planet:name><planet:http_status>200</planet:http_status></source></entry>
