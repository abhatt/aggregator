To divulgate the theory of computation isn’t as easy, since you can’t talk about mega experiments done at the South Pole or massive telescopes built on top of mountains.  (It would also be a lot easier if we could resolve P vs. NP.)  For some inspiration we can look at books related to mathematics.  Here I would like to recommend <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Symmetry-Journey-into-Patterns-Nature/dp/0060789417">Symmetry</a></em>, by <span class="author notFaded"><span class="a-size-small a-color-secondary">Marcus du Sautoy</span>.  I enjoyed very much reading and re-reading this book, much more than his previous book <em>The music of the primes</em>, which I don’t really recommend.  <em>Symmetry</em> is a gripping history of group theory.  The purpose isn’t so much explaining the math as making you excited about the historical developments of the theory and the people that worked and are working on it.</span></span></p></div></content><updated planet:format="December 06, 2018 08:01 PM">2018-12-06T20:01:49Z</updated><published planet:format="December 06, 2018 08:01 PM">2018-12-06T20:01:49Z</published><category term="Uncategorized"/><author><name>Emanuele</name></author><source><id>https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com</id><logo>https://s0.wp.com/i/buttonw-com.png</logo><link href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/feed/" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/osd.xml" rel="search" type="application/opensearchdescription+xml"/><link href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/?pushpress=hub" rel="hub" type="text/html"/><subtitle>By Emanuele Viola</subtitle><title>Thoughts</title><updated planet:format="December 17, 2018 05:30 AM">2018-12-17T05:30:13Z</updated><planet:module>toc</planet:module><planet:format>atom10</planet:format><planet:http_last_modified>Thu, 06 Dec 2018 20:12:45 GMT</planet:http_last_modified><planet:bozo>false</planet:bozo><planet:items_per_page>40</planet:items_per_page><planet:css-id>emanuele-viola</planet:css-id><planet:face>viola.jpeg</planet:face><planet:name>Emanuele Viola</planet:name><planet:http_location>https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/feed/</planet:http_location><planet:http_status>301</planet:http_status></source></entry>
