<p>I’m going to be doing a version of “ask me anything” on the CyberFETCH.org website. (See announcement below.) The first question you can ask me is “why don’t you blog more often…?”</p>
<p>———————————————</p>
<p>CyberFETCH.org is a DHS Science &amp; Technology sponsored web site that is a repository for all NIST test results for cyber forensic tools.  It also hosts a community forum for discussions of best tools and practices in a vendor neutral and secure environment.</p>
<p>CyberFETCH is now hosting a series of community driven interviews with key people in the cyber / forensics community, which we are calling “Spotlights”.  These will be similar to the “Ask Me Anything” sessions on Reddit (reddit.com/r/AMA).  Rather than being completely open-forum and live though, we work with the guest and the community by moderating the exchange, making this more like the interview format popular on SlashDot (<a href="http://slashdot.org/tag/interviews" rel="nofollow">http://slashdot.org/tag/interviews</a>).</p>
<p>We have three excellent volunteers to start this off with, all set and ready for your questions…</p>
<p>    Dr. Marcus Rogers, Director of the Cyber Forensics Program Purdue University, popular guest lecturer, expert in digital forensics, founder of the Digital Forensics Certification Board<br/>
    Dr. Jim Lyle, Project leader for the Computer Forensic Tool Testing project at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)<br/>
    Dr. Jonathan Katz, Co-author of “Introduction to Modern Cryptology”, Director, Maryland Cybersecurity Center and Professor, Dept. of Computer Science, University of Maryland</p>
<p>Many more will follow (and we’re wide open to your suggestions on who else we should invite to the Spotlight).</p>
<p>So please, check out the link below.  Read the bio, see who piques your curiosity, and send in some questions.  Don’t be bashful.  <img alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;"/></p>
