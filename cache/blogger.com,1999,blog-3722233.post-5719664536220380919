<i>If you think a theorem is true then spend half of your time trying to prove that its true, and half trying to prove that its false.</i><br/>
<i><br/></i>
I thought it was Erdos but I could not find any connection between him and the saying. I did find something that indicates he<i> did not </i>say it:<br/>
<br/>
An Erdos problem that pays different amounts of money for the conjecture being true of false:<br/>

For a finite family F of graphs, let t(n,F) denote the smallest integer m that every graph on n vertices and m edges must contain a member of F as a subgraph.<br/>
<br/>
A problem on Turán numbers for graphs with degree constraints} (proposed by Erdös and Simonovits [1]. $250 for a proof and $100 for a counterexample)<br/>
<br/>
Prove or disprove that<br/>
t(n,H)=O(n^{3/2})<br/>
t(n,H)=O(n^{3/2})<br/>
if and only if H does not contain a subgraph each vertex of which has degree &gt;2<br/>

A while back there was a $1,000,000 prize for PROVING Goldbach's conjecture (the prize had a deadline which is past). See <a href="https://www.math.tugraz.at/~elsholtz/WWW/papers/papers14faber.html">here</a>. However, the article does not say what you win for a counterexample. I suspect nothing. Is this fair? (1) YES- proving Goldbach would be hard, where as if its false just finding the counterexample likely won't require hard math, (2) NO- HEY, they resolved it, so there, (3) Have a panel look at the solution and decide if it has merit.<br/>
