<p>Success in your career will be determined more by your weaknesses than<br/>
by your strengths. Thus, if you imagine plotting a sequence of scores<br/>
that rate your ability to carry out different kinds of tasks, it’s<br/>
far better to have a high minimum than a high maximum. Try to identify<br/>
your weaknesses and to overcome as many as you can.</p>
<p>Every large project has parts that are fun and parts that are dull.<br/>
Learn to get through the dull parts. Never postpone a<br/>
distasteful-but-necessary portion of work-to-be-done, unless<br/>
there’s a very good reason why you’ll be able to do it better later.</p>
<p>Niels Hendrik Abel gave wonderful advice: “Read the masters!”<br/>
Take the time to read lots of papers that were written by top researchers<br/>
when they were first discovering important ideas. Study the works of<br/>
great computer scientists, and do your best to understand their mindset.<br/>
In order to do this well, you’ll have to learn how to put yourself into<br/>
their place — remembering what they knew and didn’t know at the time,<br/>
and adjusting to their terminology and notation. The exercise of “getting<br/>
inside another person’s head” is, in itself, extremely valuable for<br/>
building your own mental skills.</p>
<p>Here’s a trick that I often use when reading a technical book or paper:<br/>
After the author has stated a problem to be solved (or a theorem to be<br/>
proved, etc.), I cover up the text and spend some time trying to solve<br/>
that problem by myself. Similarly, before turning the page, I try to<br/>
guess what’s on the next page. Of course I usually fail … but even<br/>
in failure, I’m much more ready to understand the author’s solution,<br/>
than if I hadn’t tried it first. Furthermore, with this modus operandi<br/>
I’m repeatedly learning new ways to get past stumbling blocks.</p>
<p>Instead of promoting yourself aggressively, you should try to write so<br/>
well that others can readily see for themselves the value of what you’ve<br/>
done. Then they’ll spontaneously also tell their friends, and the<br/>
word will spread. On the other hand, if a good writer comes to you and<br/>
wants to publish an account of your work, it never hurts to have a<br/>
good “press agent”.</p>

<p>PS. (from Don) re “reading the masters”</p>
<p>“The purpose of … reading is precisely to suspend one’s mind<br/>
in the workings of another sensibility”.<br/>
— Guy Davenport, quoted in Harvard Magazine Nov-Dec 2017, p54</p>
