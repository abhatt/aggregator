How about Napier as inventing (or something) logs?</title><summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b>Darling:</b> Bill, help me with this crossword puzzle. 6 letter word that begins with N, clue is log man<br/>
<br/>
<b>Bill:</b> Napier<br/>
<br/>
<b>Darling</b>: Who was that?<br/>
<br/>
<b>Bill: </b>A famous lumberjack<br/>
<br/>
<b>Darling:</b> Give me a serious answer<br/>
<br/>
<b>Bill:</b> Okay. He is said to have invented logarithms. Like most things in math its not quite clear who gets the credit, but he was involved with logarithms early on.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Darling</b>: I said give me a serious answer. That is rather obscure and would not be in a crossword puzzle.<br/>
<br/>
While darling is wrong about the answer being wrong she is right about it being obscure. How would your typical crossword puzzler know the answer? Perhaps Napier appears in a lot of crosswords since it has lots of vowels, so they just word-associate `log man' to `Napier'  But in any case this does seem odd for a crossword puzzle.<br/>
<br/>
In the quiz show Jeopardy, in round two, the following was an $800 question under philosophy (the questions are 400,800,1200,1600,2000, so 800 is supposed to be easy)<br/>
<br/>
<i>In 1965 Lotfi Zadeh introduced this type of set with no clear boundaries leading to the same type of ``logic''</i><br/>
<i><br/></i>
1) I suspect that all my readers know that the correct response is `Fuzzy' (or formally `What is Fuzzy')<br/>
<br/>
2) Why is this in Philosophy? There IS an entry of it in the Stanford Enc of Phil (see <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-fuzzy/">here</a>). Some Philosophers work on Logic, but do they work on Fuzzy Logic? The wikipedia page for Fuzzy Logic (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic">here</a>) has only one mention of phil and its to the Stanford Enc of Phil chapter.<br/>
<br/>
3) (more my point) Is Fuzzy Logic so well known as to be an easy question on Jeop? See next point<br/>
<br/>
4) Can someone get this one right WITHOUT knowing ever having heard of Fuzzy Logic. I suspect yes and, indeed, the contestant DID get it right and I think she had never heard of Fuzzy Logic. While I can't be sure one tell is that when a contestant says `what is fuzzy logic' and it actually sounds like a question, then they are partially guessing.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I am surprised that this obscure bit of math made it into an easy question on Jeop. But since the contestant got it right, it was appropriate.</div><div class="commentbar"><p/></div></summary><updated planet:format="November 06, 2018 12:01 AM">2018-11-06T00:01:00Z</updated><published planet:format="November 06, 2018 12:01 AM">2018-11-06T00:01:00Z</published><author><name>GASARCH</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><source><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3722233</id><category term="typecast"/><category term="focs metacomments"/><author><name>Lance Fortnow</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><link href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><subtitle>Computational Complexity and other fun stuff in math and computer science from Lance Fortnow and Bill Gasarch</subtitle><title>Computational Complexity</title><updated planet:format="December 17, 2018 01:56 AM">2018-12-17T01:56:57Z</updated><planet:module>toc</planet:module><planet:format>atom10</planet:format><planet:http_etag>W/&quot;3c48828af0b9b548c409eba7b894fc342a0679ccd23a3f1db96c1212435d64c9&quot;</planet:http_etag><planet:http_last_modified>Sun, 16 Dec 2018 21:24:54 GMT</planet:http_last_modified><planet:bozo>false</planet:bozo><planet:items_per_page>40</planet:items_per_page><planet:css-id>computational-complexity</planet:css-id><planet:face>gasarch.png</planet:face><planet:name>Computational Complexity</planet:name><planet:http_status>200</planet:http_status></source></entry>
